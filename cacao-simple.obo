comment: Quantification: Many-to-many (0,n: 0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property associates an Entity with a specific Social Movement. A Social Movement is defined as a loosely organized effort by a large group of people to achieve a particular set of goals (e.g., political, cultural, or religious change). Through this property, one can record an artist’s participation in or influence from a social movement and, similarly, document how a creative work may be representative of or inspired by such a movement. \n\nExamples:\n- An artist (E21 Person) who was actively involved in the Civil Rights Movement might be linked via the movement property to that Social Movement.\n- A poster or photograph (E22 Physical Artefact) produced during a protest could be associated with the relevant Social Movement that motivated its creation.

comment: Quantification: Many-to-many (0,n: 0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property links an instance of an Actor (typically an instance of E21 Person) with a Field of Work, an element of the controlled vocabulary defined as a subclass of E55 Type. It is used to classify the professional or creative domain in which an Actor (especially an artist) is active. \n\nExamples:\n- An artist (E21 Person) might have a fieldOfWork assignment indicating they work in “Painting” (an instance of Field of Work).\n- A creator could be linked to the fieldOfWork “Sculpture” as well as “Mixed Media,” reflecting multiple areas of engagement.

comment: Quantification: Many-to-many (0,n: 0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property associates an entity,such as a person (e.g., an artist) or a physical artefact (e.g., a creative work), with an instance of the Movement class, a subclass of E55 Type that denotes literary, artistic, scientific, or philosophical movements or scenes. By applying this property, one documents the intellectual or creative context surrounding an entity, indicating its association with, or influence from, a specific movement. \n\nExamples:\n- An artist might be associated with the movement Modernism.\n- A painting might be linked to the artistic movement Impressionism.\n- A literary work might be classified under the movement Romanticism.

comment: Quantification: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property describes the naming or identification of any real-world item by a name or any other identifier. \nThis property is intended for identifiers in general use, which form part of the world the model intends to describe, and not merely for internal database identifiers which are specific to a technical system, unless these latter also have a more general use outside the technical context. This property includes in particular identification by mathematical expressions such as coordinate systems used for the identification of instances of E53 Place. The property does not reveal anything about when, where and by whom this identifier was used. A more detailed representation can be made using the fully developed (i.e. indirect) path through E15 Identifier Assignment.\nThis property is a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P140i was attributed by, E15 Identifier Assignment, P37 assigned to E42 Identifier. \nIt is also a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P1 is identified by, E41 Appellation, P139 has alternative form to E41 Appellation.\n\nExamples:\n- The capital of Italy (E53) is identified by “Rome” (E41). (Leach, 2017)\n- Text 25014–32 (E33) is identified by “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” (E35).

comment: Quantification: many to many, necessary (1,n:0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property records the dimension that was observed in an E16 Measurement Event.\nE54 Dimension can be any quantifiable aspect of E70 Thing. Weight, image colour depth and monetary value are dimensions in this sense. One measurement activity may determine more than one dimension of one object.\nDimensions may be determined either by direct observation or using recorded evidence. In the latter case the measured Thing does not need to be present or extant.\nEven though knowledge of the value of a dimension requires measurement, the dimension may be an object of discourse prior to, or even without, any measurement being made.\n\nExamples:\n- The measurement of the height of silver cup 232 on 31(st) August 1997 (E16) observed dimension silver cup 232 height (E54). [which has unit mm (E58), has value 224 (E60)] (fictitious)\n- The carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 (E16) observed dimension the carbon 14 based temporal distance from 1996 to the growth of the wood of the “Schoeninger Speer II” (E60). [The carbon 14 dating of an approximately 400.000 year old complete Old Palaeolithic wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niederachsen, Germany, in 1995. See also: E16 Measurement.] (Kouwenhoven, 1997)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P40(x,y) ⇒ E16(x)\n- P40(x,y)⇒ E54(y)\n- P40(x,y) ⇒ P141(x,y)\n
