comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises instances of E7 Activity that are undertaken to create, alter or change instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.\nThis class includes the production of an item from raw materials and other so far undocumented objects. It also includes the conservation treatment of an object.\nSince the distinction between modification and production is not always clear, modification is regarded as the more generally applicable concept. This implies that some items may be consumed or destroyed in an instance of E11 Modification, and that others may be produced as a result of it. An event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities.\nAn activity undertaken on an object which was designed to alter it, but which, in fact, it did not in any seemingly significant way (such as the application of a solvent during conservation which failed to dissolve any part of the object), is still considered as an instance of E11 Modification. Typically, any such activity will leave at least forensic traces of evidence on the object.\nIf the instance of E29 Design or Procedure utilized for the modification prescribes the use of specific materials, they should be documented using property P68 foresees use of (use foreseen by): E57 Material of E29 Design or Procedure, rather than via P126 employed (was employed in): E57 Material.\n\nExamples:\n- the construction of the SS Great Britain (E12) (Gregor, 1971)\n- the impregnation of the Vasa warship in Stockholm for preservation after 1956 (Håfors, 2010)\n- the transformation of the Enola Gay into a museum exhibit by the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC between 1993 and 1995 (E12, E81) (Yakel, 2000)\n- the last renewal of the gold coating of the Toshogu shrine in Nikko, Japan (Cali and Dougil, 2012)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E11(x) ⇒ E7(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises activities that are designed to, and succeed in, creating one or more new items. \nIt specializes the notion of modification into production. The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered “new” if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered “new” because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one. \nThis entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event. \nAn event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.\n\nExamples:\n- the construction of the SS Great Britain (Gregor, 1971)\n- the first casting of the Little Mermaid from the harbour of Copenhagen (Dewey, 2003)\n- Rembrandt’s creating of the seventh state of his etching “Woman sitting half dressed beside a stove”, 1658, identified by Bartsch Number 197 (E12, E65, E81) (Hind, 1923)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E12(x) ⇒ E11(x)\n- E12(x) ⇒ E63(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises actions measuring physical properties and other values that can be determined by a systematic, objective procedure of direct observation of particular states of physical reality. \nAn instance of E16 Measurement may use simple counting or tools, such as yardsticks or radiation detection devices. The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Methods and devices employed should be associated with instances of E16 Measurement by properties such as P33 used specific technique: E29 Design or Procedure, P125 used object of type: E55 Type, P16 used specific object (was used for): E70 Thing, whereas basic techniques such as "carbon-14 dating" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of): E55 Type. Details of methods and devices reused or reusable in other instances of E16 Measurement should be documented for these entities rather than the measurements themselves, whereas details of particular execution may be documented by free text or by instantiating adequate sub-activities, if the detail may be of interest for an overarching query.\nRegardless whether a measurement is made by an instrument or by human senses, it represents the initial transition from physical reality to information without any other documented information object in between within the reasoning chain that would represent the result of the interaction of the observer or device with reality. Therefore, determining properties of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is regarded as an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment, which may be inferred from observing and measuring representative carriers. In the case that the carrier can be named, the property P16 used specific object (was used for) should be used to indicate the instance(s) of E18 Physical Thing that was used as the empirical basis for the attribute assignment. For instance, inferring properties of depicted items using image material, such as satellite images, is not regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement, but as a subsequent instance of E13 Attribute Assignment. Rather, only the production of the images, understood as arrays of radiation intensities, is regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement. The same reasoning holds for other sensor data.\n\nExamples:\n- measurement of the height of silver cup 232 on 31(st) August 1997 (fictitious)\n- the carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 [The carbon 14 dating of an approximately 400.000 year old complete Old Palaeolithic wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niedersachsen, Germany, in 1995.] (Kouwenhoven, 1997)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E16(x) ⇒ E13(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises real persons who live or are assumed to have lived. \nLegendary figures that may have existed, such as Ulysses and King Arthur, fall into this class if the documentation refers to them as historical figures. In cases where doubt exists as to whether several persons are in fact identical, multiple instances can be created and linked to indicate their relationship. The CIDOC CRM does not propose a specific form to support reasoning about possible identity.\nIn a bibliographic context, a name presented following the conventions usually employed for personal names will be assumed to correspond to an actual real person (an instance of E21 Person), unless evidence is available to indicate that this is not the case. The fact that a persona may erroneously be classified as an instance of E21 Person does not imply that the concept comprises personae.\n\nExamples:\n- Tut-Ankh-Amun (Edwards and Boltin, 1979)\n- Nelson Mandela (Brown and Hort, 2006)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E21(x) ⇒ E20(x)\n- E21(x) ⇒ E39(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises all signs, either meaningful or not, or arrangements of signs following a specific syntax, that are used or can be used to refer to and identify a specific instance of some class within a certain context.\nInstances of E41 Appellation do not identify things by their meaning, even if they happen to have one, but by convention, tradition, or agreement. Instances of E41 Appellation are cultural constructs; as such, they have a context, a history, and a use in time and space by some group of users. A given instance of E41 Appellation can have alternative forms, i.e. other instances of E41 Appellation that are regarded as equivalent, regardless of the thing it denotes.\nDifferent languages may use different appellations for the same thing, such as the names of major cities. Some appellations may be formulated using a valid noun phrase of a particular language. In these cases, the respective instances of E41 Appellation should also be declared as instances of E33 Linguistic Object. Then the language using the appellation can be declared with the property P72 has language: E56 Language.\nInstances of E41 Appellation may be used to identify any instance of E1 CRM Entity and sometimes are characteristic for instances of more specific subclasses of E1 CRM Entity, such as for instances of E52 Time-Span (for instance “dates”), E39 Actor, E53 Place or E28 Conceptual Object. Postal addresses and E-mail addresses are characteristic examples of identifiers used by services transporting things between clients.\nEven numerically expressed identifiers for extents in space or time are also regarded as instances of E41 Appellation, such as Gregorian dates or spatial coordinates, even though they allow for determining some time or location by a known procedure starting from a reference point and by virtue of that fact play a double role as instances of E59 Primitive Value.\nE41 Appellation should not be confused with the act of naming something. Cf. E15 Identifier Assignment.\n\nExamples:\n- “Martin”\n- “Aquae Sulis Minerva”\n- “the Merchant of Venice” (E35) (McCullough, 2005)\n- “Spigelia marilandica (L.)

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.\nIt is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an instance of E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.\nOften, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore, E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical birth, an instance of E67 Birth, can be seen as both a single event, i.e. an instance of E5 Event, and as an extended period, i.e. an instance of E4 Period, that consists of multiple physical processes and complementary activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\nE4 Period is a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime Volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CIDOC CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance, it is possible to discuss the physical extent of an instance of E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomenon while an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore, this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\nTypical use of this class in cultural heritage documentation is for documenting cultural and artistic periods. There are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period in the European sphere of influence lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\nA geopolitical unit as a specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena related to the claim of power, the consequences of belonging to a jurisdictional area and an administrative system that establishes a geopolitical unit. Examples from the modern period are countries or administrative areas of countries such as districts whose actions and structures define activities and phenomena in the area that they intend to govern. The borders of geopolitical units are often defined in contracts or treaties although they may deviate from the actual practice. The spatiotemporal properties of Geopolitical units can be modelled through the properties inherited from E92 Spacetime Volume.\nAnother specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the actual extent of the set of activities and phenomena as evidenced by their physical traces that define a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n\nExamples:\n- Jurassic (Hallam, 1975)\n- Populated Period of Nineveh\n- Imperial Rome under Marcus Aurelius\n- European Bronze Age (Harrison, 2004) \n- Italian Renaissance (Macdonald, 1992)\n- Thirty Years War (Lee, 1991)\n- Sturm und Drang (Berkoff, 2013)\n- Cubism (Cox, 2000)\n- The Capital of Russia (E4) [the capital of Russia in the sense of an administrative unit moved in historical times from Moscow to St Petersburg and then back to Moscow. This exemplifies an administrative unit changing place over time without temporal discontinuity]\n- The settling activity of the community of Helsinki (a.k.a. Helsingfors) (E7) [the original settlement called Helsinki was located in the area of the modern airport. The community moved later to settle on the coast. This exemplifies a continued activity changing place over time without temporal discontinuity]\n- Bronze Age (E4) [Bronze Age, in the sense of technological adoption, spread over disjoint areas including islands such as the British Isles without temporal discontinuity]\n- Japan, the state (E4) [In 2021, the Japanese state as a political unit comprised in 6852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E4(x) ⇒ E2(x)\n- E4(x) ⇒ E92(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises abstract temporal extents, in the sense of Galilean physics, having a beginning, an end, and a duration. \nInstances of E52 Time-Span have no semantic connotations about phenomena happening within the temporal extent they represent. They do not convey any meaning other than a positioning on the “time-line” of chronology. The actual extent of an instance of E52 Time-Span can be approximated by properties of E52 Time-Span giving inner and outer bounds in the form of dates (instances of E61 Time Primitive). Comparing knowledge about time-spans is fundamental for chronological reasoning.\nSome instances of E52 Time-Span may be defined as the actual, in principle observable, temporal extent of instances of E2 Temporal Entity via the property P4 has time-span (is time-span of): E52 Time-Span. They constitute phenomenal time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013). Since our knowledge of history is imperfect and physical phenomena are fuzzy in nature, the extent of phenomenal time-spans can only be described in approximation. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an instance of E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. It may, nevertheless, be associated with other descriptions by which people can infer knowledge about it, such as in relative chronologies.\nSome instances of E52 may be defined precisely as representing a declaration of a temporal extent, as, for instance, done in a business contract. They constitute declarative time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013) and can be described via the property E61 Time Primitive P170 defines time (time is defined by): E52 Time-Span. \nWhen used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it will nevertheless describe them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else is known.\n\nExamples:\n- 1961\n- From 12-17-1993 to 12-8-1996\n- 14h30 to 16h22 4(th) July 1945\n- 9.30 am 1.1.1999 to 2.00 pm 1.1.1999\n- the time-span of the Ming Dynasty (Chan, 2011)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E52(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises extents in the natural space where people live, in particular on the surface of the Earth, in the pure sense of physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter. They may serve describing the physical location of things or phenomena or other areas of interest. Geometrically, instances of E53 Place constitute single contiguous areas or a finite aggregation of disjoint areas in space which are each individually contiguous. They may have fuzzy boundaries.\nThe instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks, but may also be determined by reference to mobile objects. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame.\nIt is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, people are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object, i.e. H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\nAny instance of E18 Physical Thing can serve as a frame of reference for an instance of E53 Place. This may be documented using the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).\n\nExamples:\n- the extent of the UK in the year 2003\n- the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring (fictitious)\n- the place referred to in the phrase: “Fish collected at three miles north of the confluence of the Arve and the Rhone”\n- here -> <- [the place between these two arrows in one of the reader's paper copy of this document. Each copy constitutes a different place of this spot.]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E53(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises quantifiable properties that can be measured by some calibrated means and can be approximated by values, i.e. points or regions in a mathematical or conceptual space, such as natural or real numbers, RGB values, etc.\nAn instance of E54 Dimension represents the empirical or theoretically derived quantity, including the precision tolerances resulting from the particular method or calculation. The identity of an instance of E54 Dimension depends on the method of its determination because each method may produce different values even when determining comparable qualities. For instance, the wingspan of a bird alive or dead is a different dimension. Thermoluminescence dating and Rehydroxylation [RHX] dating are different dimensions of temporal distance from now, even if they aim at dating the same object. The method of determination should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). Note that simple terms such as “diameter” or “length” are normally insufficient to unambiguously describe a respective dimension. In contrast, “maximum linear extent” may be sufficient.\nThe properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of instances of E54 Dimension adequate to the precision of the applied method of determination. If the respective quantity belongs to a non-discrete space according to the laws of physics, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that comparability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.\nNumerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension, as appropriate.\n\nExamples:\n- the weight of the Luxor Obelisk [250 metric tons]\n- the vertical height of the statue of David by Michelangelo [5.17 metres]\n- the weight of the Great Star of Africa diamond [530.2 carats]\n- the calibrated C14 date for the Shroud of Turin [AD1262-1312, 1303-1384]\n- the horizontal diameter of the Stonehenge Sarsen Circle [33 metres] (Pryor, 2016)\n- the length of the sides of the Great Pyramid at Giza [230.34 metres] (Lehner and Hawass, 2017)\n- the duration of the time-span of the Battle of Issos/Issus on 15(th) November 333 B.C.E. [less than 12 hours] (Howard, 2012)\n- Christie’s hammer price, in British Pounds, for Vincent van Gogh's "Still Life: Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers" in London on 30(th) March 1987 (E97) [24.75 million GBP (British Pounds)]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E54(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises distinct, delimited and coherent processes and interactions of a material nature, in cultural, social or physical systems, involving and affecting instances of E77 Persistent Item in a way characteristic of the kind of process. Typical examples are meetings, births, deaths, actions of decision taking, making or inventing things, but also more complex and extended ones such as conferences, elections, building of a castle, or battles.\nWhile the continuous growth of a tree lacks the limits characteristic of an event, its germination from a seed does qualify as an event. Similarly, the blowing of the wind lacks the distinctness and limits of an event, but a hurricane, flood or earthquake would qualify as an event. Mental processes are considered as events, in cases where they are connected with the material externalization of their results; for example, the creation of a poem, a performance or a change of intention that becomes obvious from subsequent actions or declarations.\nThe effects of an instance of E5 Event may not lead to relevant permanent changes of properties or relations of the items involved in it, for example an unrecorded performance. Of course, in order to be documented, some kind of evidence for an event must exist, be it witnesses, traces or products of the event.\nWhile instances of E4 Period always require some form of coherence between its constituent phenomena, in addition, the essential constituents of instances of E5 Event should contribute to an overall effect; for example, the statements made during a meeting and the listening of the audience.\nViewed at a coarse level of detail, an instance of E5 Event may appear as if it had an ‘instantaneous’ overall effect, but any process or interaction of material nature in reality have an extent in time and space. At a fine level, instances of E5 Event may be analysed into component phenomena and phases within a space and timeframe, and as such can be seen as a period, regardless of the size of the phenomena. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy overall effect and are thus not instances of E5 Event.\n\nExamples:\n- the birth of Cleopatra (E67) (Pomeroy, 1984)\n- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD (E6) (Camardo, 2013)\n- World War II (E7) (Barber, 1994)\n- the Battle of Stalingrad (E7) (Hoyt, 1993)\n- the Yalta Conference (E7) (Harbutt, 2010)\n- my birthday celebration 28-6-1995 (E7)\n- the falling of a tile from my roof last Sunday (fictitious)\n- the CIDOC conference 2003 (E7)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E5(x) ⇒ E4(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises events that destroy one or more instances of E18 Physical Thing, such that they lose their identity as the subjects of documentation.\nSome destruction events are intentional, while others are independent of human activity. Intentional destruction can be documented by classifying the event as both an instance of E6 Destruction and of E7 Activity. \nThe decision to document an object as destroyed, transformed, or modified is context-sensitive: \n1. If the matter remaining from the destruction is not documented, the event is modelled solely as an instance of E6 Destruction. \n2. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the original. In this case, the new items have separate identities. Matter is preserved, but identity is not.\n3. When the initial identity of the changed instance of E18 Physical Thing is preserved, the event should be documented as an instance of E11 Modification.\n\nExamples:\n- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD (Camardo, 2013)\n- the destruction of Nineveh (E6, E7) (River, 2016) \n- the breaking of a champagne glass yesterday by my dog (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E6(x) ⇒ E64(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises any gatherings or organizations of human individuals or groups that act collectively or in a similar way due to any form of unifying relationship. In the wider sense this class also comprises official positions which used to be regarded in certain contexts as one actor, independent of the current holder of the office, such as the president of a country. In such cases, it may happen that the group never had more than one member. A joint pseudonym (i.e. a name that seems indicative of an individual but that is actually used as a persona by two or more people) is a particular case of E74 Group.\nA gathering of people becomes an instance of E74 Group when it exhibits organizational characteristics usually typified by a set of ideas or beliefs held in common, or actions performed together. These might be communication, creating some common artifact, a common purpose such as study, worship, business, sports, etc. Nationality can be modelled as membership in an instance of E74 Group. Married couples and other concepts of family are regarded as particular examples of E74 Group.\n\nExamples:\n- the Impressionists (Wilson, 1994)\n- the Navajo (Correll, 1972)\n- the Greeks (Williams, 1993)\n- the peace protestors in New York City on 15(th) February 2003\n- Exxon-Mobil (Raymond, 2006)\n- King Solomon and his wives (Thieberger, 1947)\n- the President of the Swiss Confederation\n- Nicolas Bourbaki [the collective pseudonym of a group of mathematicians, predominantly French alumni of the École normale supérieure] (Aczel, 2007)\n- Betty Crocker (Crocker, 2012)\n- Ellery Queen [Ellery Queen is a pseudonym created in 1929 by American crime fiction writers Frederic Dannay and Manfred Bennington Lee.] (Wheat, 2005)\n- Greenpeace\n- Paveprime Ltd\n- the National Museum of Denmark\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E74(x) ⇒ E39(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises the events that result in the simultaneous destruction of one or more than one E18 Physical Thing and the creation of one or more than one E18 Physical Thing that preserves recognizable substance and structure from the first one(s) but has fundamentally different nature or identity.\nAlthough the old and the new instances of E18 Physical Thing are treated as discrete entities having separate, unique identities, they are causally connected through the E81 Transformation; the destruction of the old E18 Physical Thing(s) directly causes the creation of the new one(s) using or preserving some relevant substance and structure. Instances of E81 Transformation are therefore distinct from re-classifications (documented using E17 Type Assignment) or modifications (documented using E11 Modification) of objects that do not fundamentally change their nature or identity. Characteristic cases are reconstructions and repurposing of historical buildings or ruins, fires leaving buildings in ruins, taxidermy of specimen in natural history.\nEven though such instances of E81 Transformation are often motivated by a change of intended use, substantial material changes should justify the documentation of the result as a new instance of E18 Physical Thing and not just the change of function. The latter may be documented as an extended activity (instance of E7 Activity) of using it.\n\nExamples:\n- the mummification of Tut-Ankh-Amun (E81, E12) [the mummification of the body of the deceased is a human production process and simultaneously preserves structures of the body at and before death] (Carter and Mace 1977)\n- the death, carbonization and petrification of some people of Pompeii in 79AD by the intense heat of a pyroclastic cloud and ashes from the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius (E69, E81)\n- the transformation of the Hephaisteion temple in Athens, better known as “Theseion”, into a Christian church, dedicated to Saint George <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George> around AD 700 (E81,E12) [which actually helped preserving part of the antique temple structure from 449BC]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E81(x) ⇒ E63(x)\n- E81(x) ⇒ E64(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises transfers of legal ownership from one or more instances of E39 Actor to one or more other instances of E39 Actor. \nThe class also applies to the establishment or loss of ownership of instances of E18 Physical Thing. It does not, however, imply changes of any other kinds of rights. The recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E8 Acquisition there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances, it may describe:\n1. the beginning of ownership\n2. the end of ownership\n3. the transfer of ownership\n4. the acquisition from an unknown source\n5. the loss of title due to destruction of the item\nIt may also describe events where a collector appropriates legal title, for example, by annexation or field collection. The interpretation of the museum notion of “accession” differs between institutions. The CIDOC CRM therefore models legal ownership (E8 Acquisition) and physical custody (E10 Transfer of Custody) separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.\n\nExamples:\n- the collection of a hammerhead shark, genus Sphyrna (Carchariniformes), by John Steinbeck and Edward Ricketts at Puerto Escondido in the Gulf of Mexico on 25(th) March 1940. (Steinbeck, 2000)\n- the acquisition of El Greco’s “The Apostles Peter and Paul” by the State Hermitage in Saint Petersburg.

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, whose temporal extent has been chosen in order to determine the spatial extent of a phenomenon over the chosen time-span. Respective phenomena may, for instance, be historical events or periods, but can also be the diachronic extent and existence of physical things. In other words, instances of this class fix a slice of another instance of E92 Spacetime Volume in time. \nThe temporal extent of an instance of E93 Presence typically is predetermined by the researcher so as to focus the investigation particularly on finding the spatial extent of the phenomenon by testing for its characteristic features. There are at least two basic directions such investigations might take. The investigation may wish to determine where something was during some time or it may wish to reconstruct the total passage of a phenomenon’s spacetime volume through an examination of discrete presences. Observation and measurement of features indicating the presence or absence of a phenomenon in some space allows for the progressive approximation of spatial extents through argumentation typically based on inclusion, exclusion and various overlaps.\n\nExamples:\n- the Roman Empire on 19(th) August AD 14 (Clare and Edwards, 1992)\n- Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s whereabouts in December 1775 (Leppmann, 1970)\n- Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s whereabouts from 19(th) November 1755 until 9(th) April 1768 (Leppmann, 1970)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E93(x) ⇒ E92(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises transfers of legal ownership from one or more instances of E39 Actor to one or more different instances of E39 Actor, where the transferring party is completely compensated by the payment of a monetary amount. In more detail, a purchase agreement establishes a fixed monetary obligation at its initialization on the receiving party, to the giving party. An instance of E96 Purchase begins with the contract or equivalent agreement and ends with the fulfilment of all contractual obligations. In the case that the activity is abandoned before both parties have fulfilled these obligations, the activity is not regarded as an instance of E96 Purchase.\nThis class is a very specific case of the much more complex social business practices of exchange of goods and the creation and satisfaction of related social obligations. Purchase activities which define individual sales prices per object can be modelled by instantiating E96 Purchase for each object individually and as part of an overall instance of E96 Purchase transaction.\n\nExamples:\n- the purchase of 10 okka of nails by the captain A. Syrmas on 18(th) September 1895 in Thessaloniki (Syrmas, 1896)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E96(x) ⇒ E8(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises the units in which a monetary system, supported by an administrative authority or other community, quantifies and arithmetically compares all monetary amounts declared in the unit. The unit of a monetary system must describe a nominal value which is kept constant by its administrative authority and an associated banking system if it exists, and not by market value. For instance, one may pay with grams of gold, but the respective monetary amount would have been agreed as the gold price in US dollars on the day of the payment. Under this definition, British Pounds, U.S. Dollars, and European Euros are examples of currency, but “grams of gold” is not. One monetary system has one and only one currency. Instances of this class must not be confused with coin denominations, such as “Dime” or “Sestertius”. Non-monetary exchange of value in terms of quantities of a particular type of goods, such as cows, do not constitute a currency.\n\nExamples:\n- “As” [Roman mid republic]\n- “Euro” (Temperton, 1997)\n- “US Dollar” (Rose, 1978)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E98(x) ⇒ E58(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises changes of the physical location of the instances of E19 Physical Object. \nNote, that the class E9 Move inherits the property P7 took place at (witnessed): E53 Place.

Moves may also be documented to consist of other moves (via P9 consists of (forms part of)), in order to describe intermediate stages on a trajectory. In that case, start and end points of the partial moves should match appropriately between each other and with the overall event.\n\nExamples:\n- the relocation of London Bridge from the UK to the USA (Wildfang, 2005)\n- the movement of the exhibition “Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh” between 15(th) September and 2(nd) November 2019\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E9(x) ⇒ E7(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises transfers of the physical custody or the legal responsibility for the physical custody of objects. The recording of the donor or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E10 Transfer of Custody there is either no donor or no recipient. \nDepending on the circumstances, it may describe: \n1. the beginning of custody (there is no previous custodian)\n2. the end of custody (there is no subsequent custodian)\n3. the transfer of custody (transfer from one custodian to the next)\n4. the receipt of custody from an unknown source (the previous custodian is unknown)\n5. the declared loss of an object (the current or subsequent custodian is unknown)\nIn the event that only a single kind of transfer of custody occurs, either the legal responsibility for the custody or the actual physical possession of the object but not both, this difference should be expressed using the property \nP2 has type (is type of).\nThe sense of physical possession requires that the object of custody be in the hands of the keeper at least with a part representative for the whole. The way, in which a representative part is defined, should ensure that it is unambiguous who keeps a part and who the whole and should be consistent with the identity criteria of the kept instance of E18 Physical Thing.\nThe interpretation of the museum notion of "accession" differs between institutions. The CIDOC CRM therefore models legal ownership and physical custody separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these. \nTheft is a specific case of illegal transfer of custody.\n\nExamples:\n- the delivery of the paintings by Secure Deliveries Inc. to the National Gallery\n- the return of Picasso’s “Guernica” to Madrid’s Prado in 1981 (Chipp, 1988)\n- the transfer of custody of the work described as “Von der Velden ein Ufer an der See” from Johann Matthäus von Merian to the Auction House Heldevier (Jacob) for the purpose of sale, ca. 1716\n- the transfer of custody of the painting ‘Mrs. Fitzherbert’ to the art dealer Knoedler from Parke-Bernet Galleries (New York, NY, USA) ca.

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises the actions of making assertions about one property of an object or any single relation between two items or concepts. The type of the property asserted to hold between two items or concepts can be described by the property P177 assigned property of type (is type of property assigned): E55 Type. \nFor example, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain scientific/scholarly procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on whether this information should be accessible by structured queries.\nThis class allows for the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. Note that all instances of properties described in a knowledge base are the opinion of someone. Per default, they are the opinion of the team maintaining the knowledge base. This fact must not individually be registered for all instances of properties provided by the maintaining team, because it would result in an endless recursion of whose opinion was the description of an opinion. Therefore, the use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment marks the fact that the maintaining team is in general neutral to the validity of the respective assertion, but registers someone else’s opinion and how it came about.\nAll properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly relating the respective pair of items or concepts. Multiple use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment may possibly lead to a collection of contradictory values.\n\nExamples:\n- the examination of MS Sinai Greek 418 by Nicholas Pickwoad in November 2003 (Honey & Pickwoad, 2010)\n- the assessment of the current ownership of Martin Doerr’s silver cup in February 1997 (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E13(x) ⇒ E7(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises activities that result in the allocation of an identifier to an instance of E1 CRM Entity. An instance of E15 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents, which themselves may be instances of E41 Appellation. The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure.\nExamples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when, and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.\nThe fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as “preferred identifier assignment”, to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment through the P2 has type (is type of) property.\n\nExamples:\n- replacement of the inventory number TA959a by GE34604 for a 17(th) century lamentation cloth at the Museum Benaki, Athens\n- assigning the author and uniform title heading “Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832. Faust. 1. Theil.” to a work \n- on 1(st) June 2001, assigning the personal name heading “Guillaume, de Machaut, ca. 1300-1377” to Guillaume de Machaut (Kelly, 2014)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E15(x) ⇒ E13(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises all persistent physical items with a relatively stable form, human-made or natural.\nDepending on the existence of natural boundaries of such things, the CIDOC CRM distinguishes the instances of E19 Physical Object from instances of E26 Physical Feature, such as holes, rivers, pieces of land, etc. Most instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy), whereas features are integral to the surrounding matter.\nAn instance of E18 Physical Thing occupies not only a particular geometric space at any instant of its existence, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces, such as the interior of a box. For the purpose of more detailed descriptions of the presence of an instance of E18 Physical Thing in space and time it can be associated with its specific instance of E92 Spacetime Volume by the property P196 defines (is defined by). \nThe CIDOC CRM is generally not concerned with amounts of matter in fluid or gaseous states, as long as they are not confined in an identifiable way for an identifiable minimal time-span.\n\nExamples:\n- the Cullinan Diamond (E19) (Scarratt and Shor, 2006)\n- the cave “Ideon Andron” in Crete (E26) (Smith, 1844-49)\n- the Mona Lisa (E22) (Mohen, 2006)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E18(x) ⇒ E72(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises items of a material nature that are units for documentation and have physical boundaries that separate them completely in an objective way from other objects. \nThe class also includes all aggregates of objects made for functional purposes of whatever kind, independent of physical coherence, such as a set of chessmen. Typically, instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy).\nIn some contexts, such objects, except for aggregates, are also called “bona fide objects”, i.e. naturally defined objects (Smith & Varzi, 2000). \nThe decision as to what is documented as a complete item, rather than by its parts or components, may be purely administrative or may be a result of the order in which the item was acquired.\n\nExamples:\n- Aphrodite of Milos (E22) (Kousser, 2005)\n- the Cullinan Diamond (Scarratt and Shor, 2006)\n- Apollo 13 at the time of launch (E22) (Lovell and Kluger, 1994)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E19(x) ⇒ E18(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises all persistent physical items of any size that are purposely created by human activity. This class comprises, besides others, human-made objects, such as a sword, and human-made features, such as rock art. For example, a “cup and ring” carving on bedrock is regarded as instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.\nInstances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing may be the result of modifying pre-existing physical things, preserving larger parts or most of the original matter and structure, which poses the question if they are new or even human-made, the respective interventions of production made on such original material should be obvious and sufficient to regard that the product has a new, distinct identity and intended function and is human-made. Substantial continuity of the previous matter and structure in the new product can be documented by describing the production process also as an instance of E81 Transformation.\nWhereas interventions of conservation and repair are not regarded to produce a new instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing, the results of preparation of natural history specimens that substantially change their natural or original state should be regarded as instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Things, including the uncovering of petrified biological features from a solid piece of stone. On the other side, scribbling a museum number on a natural object should not be regarded to make it human-made. This notwithstanding, parts, sections, segments, or features of an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing may continue to be non-human-made and preserved during the production process, for example natural pearls used as a part of an eardrop.\n\nExamples:\n- the Forth Railway Bridge (Shipway, Bouch, Baker and Fowler, 1990).\n- the Channel Tunnel (E25) (Holliday, Marcou and Vickerman, 1991)\n- the Palace of Knossos (Evans, 1921)\n- the Colosseum in Rome, Italy (Hopkins and Beard, 2011)\n- the Historical Collection of the Museum Benaki in Athens (E78) (Georgoula, 2005)\n- the Rosetta Stone (E22)\n- my paperback copy of Crime & Punishment (E22) (fictitious)\n- the computer disk at ICS-FORTH that stores the canonical Definition of the CIDOC CRM v.3.2 (E22)\n- my empty DVD disk (E22) (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E24(x) ⇒ E18(x)\n- E24(x) ⇒ E71(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises identifiable features that are physically attached in an integral way to particular physical objects. \nInstances of E26 Physical Feature share many of the attributes of instances of E19 Physical Object. They may have a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not. \nInstances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature. \nThis definition coincides with the definition of “fiat objects”, with the exception of aggregates of “bona fide objects” (Smith & Varzi, 2000).\n\nExamples:\n- the cave of Dirou, Mani, Greece (Psimenos. 2005)\n- the temple in Abu Simbel before its removal, which was carved out of solid rock (E25) (Hawass, 2000)\n- Albrecht Duerer's signature on his painting of Charles the Great (E25) (Strauss, 1974)\n- the damage to the nose of the Great Sphinx in Giza (Temple, 2009)\n- Michael Jackson’s nose prior to plastic surgery\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E26(x) ⇒ E18(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises documented plans for the execution of actions in order to achieve a result of a specific quality, form, or contents. In particular, it comprises plans for deliberate human activities that may result in new instances of E71 Human-Made Thing or for shaping or guiding the execution of an instance of E7 Activity.\nInstances of E29 Design or Procedure can be structured in parts and sequences or depend on others.\nThis is modelled using P69 has association with (is associated with): E29 Design or Procedure.\nDesigns or procedures can be seen as one of the following:\n1. A schema for the activities it describes\n2. A schema of the products that result from their application\n3. An independent intellectual product that may have never been applied, such as Leonardo da Vinci’s famous plans for flying machines\nBecause designs or procedures may never be applied or only partially executed, the CIDOC CRM models a loose relationship between the plan and the respective product.\n\nExamples:\n- the ISO standardisation procedure\n- the musical notation for Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” (Kershaw, 1999)\n- the architectural drawings for the Kölner Dom (Cologne Cathedral) in Cologne, Germany (Wolff, 1999)\n- the drawing found on Folio 860 of the Codex Atlanticus from Leonardo da Vinci, 1486 to 1490, kept in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E29(x) ⇒ E73(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises all phenomena, such as the instances of E4 Periods and E5 Events, which happen over a limited extent in time. This extent in time must be contiguous, i.e., without gaps. In case the defining kinds of phenomena for an instance of E2 Temporal Entity cease to happen, and occur later again at another time, we regard that the former instance of E2 Temporal Entity has ended and a new instance has come into existence. In more intuitive terms, the same event cannot happen twice.\nIn some contexts, such phenomena are also called perdurants. This class is disjoint from E77 Persistent Item and is an abstract class that typically has no direct instances. E2 Temporal Entity is specialized into E4 Period, which applies to a particular geographic area (defined with a greater or lesser degree of precision), and E3 Condition State, which applies to instances of E18 Physical Thing.\n\nExamples:\n- Bronze Age (E4) (Childe, 1963)\n- the earthquake in Lisbon 1755 (E5) (Chester, 2001)\n- the Peterhof Palace near Saint Petersburg being in ruins from 1944 to 1946 (E3) (Maddox, 2015)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E2(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises identifiable expressions in natural language or languages. \nInstances of E33 Linguistic Object can be expressed in many ways: e.g. as written texts, recorded speech, or sign language. However, the CIDOC CRM treats instances of E33 Linguistic Object independently from the medium or method by which they are expressed. Expressions in formal languages, such as computer code or mathematical formulae, are not treated as instances of E33 Linguistic Object by the CIDOC CRM. These should be modelled as instances of E73 Information Object.\nIn general, an instance of E33 Linguistic Object may also contain non-linguistic information, often of artistic or aesthetic value. Only in cases in which the content of an instance of E33 Linguistic Object can completely be expressed by a series of binary-encoded symbols, its content may be documented within a respective knowledge base by the property P190 has symbolic content: E62 String. Otherwise, it should be understood as an identifiable digital resource only available independently from the respective knowledge base. \nIn other cases, such as pages of an illuminated manuscript or recordings containing speech in a language supported by a writing system, the linguistic part of the content of an instance of E33 Linguistic Object may be documented within a respective knowledge base in a note by P3 has note: E62 String. Otherwise, it may be described using the property P165 incorporates (is incorporated in): E73 Information Object as a different object with its own identity.\n\nExamples:\n- the text of the Ellesmere Chaucer manuscript (Hilmo, 2019)\n- the lyrics of the song “Blue Suede Shoes” (Cooper, 2008)\n- the text of the “Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll (Carroll, 1981)\n- the text of “Doktoro Jekyll kaj Sinjoro Hyde” [an Esperanto translation of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]. (Stevenson, Morrison and Mann, 1909)\n- the free dialog in the local dialect recorded in 1958, Telemark, Norway stored on tape or.7-89.s1 (00.15:46-00:34), The Language Collection at the University Library in Bergen, Norway (verified on 2020)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E33(x) ⇒ E73(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises the intellectual or conceptual aspects of recognisable marks and images.\nThis class does not intend to describe the idiosyncratic characteristics of an individual physical embodiment of a visual item, but the underlying prototype. For example, a mark such as the ICOM logo is generally considered to be the same logo when used on any number of publications. The size, orientation, and colour may change, but the logo remains uniquely identifiable. The same is true of images that are reproduced many times. This means that visual items are independent of their physical support.\nThe E36 Visual Item class provides a means of identifying and linking together instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing that carry the same visual symbols, marks, or images, etc. The property P62 depicts (is depicted by) between E24 Physical Human-Made Thing and the depicted subjects (E1 CRM Entity) can be regarded as a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E24 Physical Human-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1 CRM Entity, which in addition captures the optical features of the depiction.\n\nExamples:\n- the visual appearance of Monet’s “La Pie” (Bortolatto, 1981)\n- the Coca-Cola logo (E34)\n- the Chi-Rho (E37)\n- the communist red star (E37)\n- the surface shape of Auguste Rodin's statue "Le Penseur" [There exist more than 20 copies, even of different size. Therefore, this is a good example that it is only the common surface shape, an immaterial visual item, which justifies displaying these copies as works of Auguste Rodin. As usual practice, Rodin himself did not produce the bronze statue, but only the prototype model.]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E36(x) ⇒ E73(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises the states of objects characterised by a certain condition over a time-span. \nAn instance of this class describes the prevailing physical condition of any material object or feature during a specific instance of E52 Time-Span. In general, the time-span for which a certain condition can be asserted may be shorter than the real time-span, for which this condition held.\nThe nature of that condition can be described using P2 has type. For example, the instance of E3 Condition State “condition of the SS Great Britain between 22(nd) September 1846 and 27(th) August 1847” can be characterized as an instance “wrecked” of E55 Type.\n\nExamples:\n- the "reconstructed" state of the “Amber Room” in Tsarskoje Selo from summer 2003 until now (Owen, 2009)\n- the "ruined" state of Peterhof Palace near Saint Petersburg from 1944 to 1946 (Maddox, 2015)\n- the state of my turkey in the oven at 14:30 on 25(th) December 2002 [P2 has type: E55 Type “still not cooked”] (fictitious)\n- the topography of the leaves of Sinai Printed Book 3234.2361 on the 10(th) July 2007 [described as: of type "cockled"] (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E3(x) ⇒ E2(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises identifiable immaterial items, such as poems, jokes, data sets, images, texts, multimedia objects, procedural prescriptions, computer program code, algorithm or mathematical formulae, that have an objectively recognizable structure and are documented as single units. The encoding structure known as a “named graph” also falls under this class, so that each “named graph” is an instance of E73 Information Object.\nAn instance of E73 Information Object does not depend on a specific physical carrier, which can include human memory, and it can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously.\nInstances of E73 Information Object of a linguistic nature should be declared as instances of the E33 Linguistic Object subclass. Instances of E73 Information Object of a documentary nature should be declared as instances of the E31 Document subclass. Conceptual items such as types and classes are not instances of E73 Information Object, nor are ideas without a reproducible expression.\n\nExamples:\n- image BM000038850.JPG from the Clayton Herbarium in London (E31) (Natural History Museum, 2021)\n- E.

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises items that have persistent characteristics of structural nature substantially related to their identity and their integrity, sometimes known as “endurants” in philosophy. Persistent Items may be physical entities, such as people, animals or things, conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or even names. \nInstances of E77 Persistent Item may be present or be part of interactions in different periods or events. They can repeatedly be recognized at disparate occasions during their existence by characteristics of structural nature. The respective characteristics need not be exactly the same during all the existence of an instance of E77 Persistent Item. Often, they undergo gradual change, still bearing some similarities with that of previous times, or disappear completely and new emerge. For instance, a person, from the time of being born on, will gradually change all its features and acquire new ones, such as a scar. Even the DNA in different body cells will develop defects and mutations. Nevertheless, relevant characteristics used should be sufficiently similar to recognize the instance for some substantial period of time. \nThe more specific criteria that determine the identity of instances of subclasses of E77 Persistent Item may vary considerably and are described or referred to in the respective scope notes. The decision about which exact criteria to use depends on whether the observable behaviour of the respective part of reality such confined conforms to the reasoning the user is interested in. For example, a building can be regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria, such as being bodily separated from other persons. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. On the opposite, the identity of a (version of a) text of a scientific publication is given by the exact arrangement of its relevant symbols. \nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope of the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties. \nAn instance of E77 Persistent Item does not require actual knowledge of the identifying features of the instance being currently known. There may be cases, where the actual identifying features of an instance of E77 Persistent Item are not decidable at a particular state of knowledge.\n\nExamples:\n- Leonardo da Vinci (E21) (Strano, 1953)\n- Stonehenge (E24) (Pryor, 2016)\n- the hole in the ozone layer (E4) (Hufford and Horwitz, 2005)\n- the First Law of Thermodynamics (E89) (Craig and Gislason, 2002)\n- the Bermuda Triangle (E53) (Dolan, 2005)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E77(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises aggregations of instances of E18 Physical Thing that are assembled and maintained (“curated” and “preserved,” in museological terminology) by one or more instances of E39 Actor over time for a specific purpose and audience, and according to a particular collection development plan. Typical instances of curated holdings are museum collections, archives, library holdings and digital libraries. A digital library is regarded as an instance of E18 Physical Thing because it requires keeping physical carriers of the electronic content.\nItems may be added or removed from an E78 Curated Holding in pursuit of this plan. This class should not be confused with the E39 Actor maintaining the E78 Curated Holding who is often referred to using the name of the E78 Curated Holding (e.g. “The Wallace Collection decided…”). \nCollective objects in the general sense, like a tomb full of gifts, a folder with stamps, or a set of chessmen, should be documented as instances of E19 Physical Object, and not as instances of E78 Curated Holding. This is because they form wholes, either because they are physically bound together or because they are kept together for their functionality.\n\nExamples:\n- the John Clayton Herbarium (Blake, 1918), (Natural History Museum, 2021)\n- the Wallace Collection (Ingamells, 1990)\n- Mikael Heggelund Foslie’s coralline red algae Herbarium at the Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, Trondheim, Norway (Woelkerling et al., 2005)\n- the Digital Collections of the Munich DigitiZation Center (MDZ) accessible via https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/ at least in January 2018.\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E78(x) ⇒ E24(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises activities that result in an instance of E18 Physical Thing being increased, enlarged, or augmented by the addition of a part. \nTypical scenarios include the attachment of an accessory, the integration of a component, the addition of an element to an aggregate object, or the accessioning of an object into a curated instance of E78 Curated Holding. Both the E18 Physical Thing being augmented and the E18 Physical Thing that is being added are treated as separate identifiable wholes prior to the instance of E79 Part Addition. Following the addition of parts, the resulting assemblages are treated objectively as single identifiable wholes, made up of constituent or component parts bound together either physically (for example the engine becoming a part of the car), or by sharing a common purpose (such as the 32 chess pieces that make up a chess set). This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history and continuity of identity of objects that are integrated into other objects over time, such as precious gemstones being repeatedly incorporated into different items of jewellery, or cultural artefacts being added to different museum instances of E78 Curated Holding over their lifespan.\n\nExamples:\n- the setting of the Koh-I-Noor diamond into the crown of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (Dalrymple, 2017)\n- the addition of the painting “Room in Brooklyn” by Edward Hopper to the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\n- the attachment of the bronze hand on the tree forming the Alpi Marittime [ https://giuseppepenone.com/en/words/maritime-alps] (Mangini, 2010)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E79(x) ⇒ E11(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises the activities that result in an instance of E18 Physical Thing being decreased by the removal of a part.\nTypical scenarios include the detachment of an accessory, the removal of a component or part of a composite object, or the deaccessioning of an object from a curated collection, an instance of E78 Curated Holding. If the instance of E80 Part Removal results in the total decomposition of the original object into pieces, such that the whole ceases to exist, the activity should instead be modelled as an instance of E81 Transformation, i.e. a simultaneous destruction and production. In cases where the part removed has no discernible identity prior to its removal but does have an identity subsequent to its removal, the activity should be modelled as both an instance of E80 Part Removal and E12 Production. This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history, and continuity of identity over time, of objects that are removed from other objects, such as precious gemstones being extracted from different items of jewellery, or cultural artifacts being deaccessioned from different museum collections over their lifespan.\n\nExamples:\n- the removal of the Porite coral specimen from the Cocos Islands by Charles Darwin in April 1836 (Natural History Museum, 2021, b)\n- the removal of the engine from my car (fictitious)\n- the disposal of object number 1976:234 from the collection (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E80(x) ⇒ E11(x)\n

The activity modelled as an instance of E83 Type Creation is central to research in the life sciences, where a type would be referred to as a “taxon,” the type description as a “protologue,” and the exemplary specimens as “original element” or “holotype”.\n\nExamples:\n- creation of the taxon Penicillium brefeldianum (Dodge, 1933)\n- addition of class E85 Joining to the CIDOC CRM\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E83(x) ⇒ E65(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises the activities that contribute to the management and the preservation and evolution of instances of E78 Curated Holding, following an implicit or explicit curation plan. \nIt specializes the notion of activity into the curation of a collection and allows the history of curation to be recorded.\nItems are accumulated and organized following criteria such as subject, chronological period, material type, style of art, etc., and can be added or removed from an instance of E78 Curated Holding for a specific purpose and/or audience. The initial aggregation of items to form a collection is regarded as an instance of E12 Production Event, while the activities of evolving, preserving, and promoting a collection are regarded as instances of E87 Curation Activity.\n\nExamples:\n- the curation of Mikael Heggelund Foslie’s coralline red algae Herbarium 1876 to 1909 (when Foslie died), now at the Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, Norway (Woelkerling et al., 2005)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E87(x) ⇒ E7(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises immaterial items, including but not limited to stories, plots, procedural prescriptions, algorithms, laws of physics or images that are, or represent in some sense, sets of propositions about real or imaginary things and that are documented as single units or serve as topic of discourse. \nThis class also comprises items that are “about” something in the sense of a subject. In the wider sense, this class includes expressions of psychological value such as non-figural art and musical themes. However, conceptual items such as types and classes are not instances of E89 Propositional Object. This should not be confused with the definition of a type, which is indeed an instance of E89 Propositional Object.\n\nExamples:\n- Maxwell’s Equations (Ball, 1962)\n- the ideational contents of Aristotle’s book entitled ‘Metaphysics’ as rendered in the Greek texts translated in Oxford edition\n- the underlying prototype of any “no-smoking” sign (E36)\n- the common ideas of the plots of the movie “The Seven Samurai” by Akira Kurosawa and the movie “The Magnificent Seven” by John Sturges (Mellen, 2002)\n- the image content of the photo of the Allied Leaders at Yalta published by UPI, 1945 (E36)\n- the character “Little Red Riding Hood”, variants of which appear amongst others in Grimm brothers’ “Rotkäppchen”, other oral fairy tales and the film “Hoodwinked”\n- the place “Havnor” as invented by Ursula K.

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises identifiable symbols and any aggregation of symbols, such as characters, identifiers, traffic signs, emblems, texts, data sets, images, musical scores, multimedia objects, computer program code, or mathematical formulae that have an objectively recognizable structure and that are documented as single units.\nIt includes sets of signs of any nature, which may serve to designate something, or to communicate some propositional content. An instance of E90 Symbolic Object may or may not have a specific meaning, for example an arbitrary character string.\nIn some cases, the content of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object may completely be represented by a serialized digital content model, such as a sequence of ASCII-encoded characters, an XML or HTML document, or a TIFF image. The property P3 has note and its subproperty P190 has symbolic content allow for the description of this content model. In order to disambiguate which symbolic level is the carrier of the meaning, the property P3.1 has type can be used to specify the encoding (e.g. “bit”, “Latin character”, RGB pixel).\n\nExamples:\n- ‘ecognizabl’\n- the “no-smoking” sign (E36)\n- “BM000038850.JPG” (E41) [identifies a digital image] (Natural History Museum, 2021)\n- image BM000038850.JPG from the Clayton Herbarium in London (E36) [depicts specimen of Verbesina virginica] (Natural History Museum, 2021)\n- the distribution of form, tone and colour found on Leonardo da Vinci’s painting named “Mona Lisa” in daylight (E36)\n- the Italian text of Dante’s “Divina Commedia” as found in the authoritative critical edition “La Commedia secondo l’antica vulgata a cura di Giorgio Petrocchi” (E33) (Petrocchi, 1967)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E90(x) ⇒ E28(x)\n- E90(x) ⇒ E72(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises 4-dimensional point sets (volumes) in physical spacetime (in contrast to mathematical models of it) regardless of their true geometric forms. They may derive their identity from being the extent of a material phenomenon or from being the interpretation of an expression defining an extent in spacetime. Intersections of instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, E53 Place, and E52 Time-Span are also regarded as instances of E92 Spacetime Volume. An instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is either contiguous or composed of a finite number of contiguous subsets. Its boundaries may be fuzzy due to the properties of the phenomena it derives from or due to the limited precision up to which defining expression can be identified with a real extent in spacetime. The duration of existence of an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is its projection on time.\n\nExamples:\n- the extent in space and time of the Event of Caesar’s murder (Irwin, 1935)\n- where and when the carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 took place (Kouwenhoven, 1997)\n- the spatio-temporal trajectory of the H.M.S. Victory from its building to its actual location (Goodwin, 2015)\n- the extent in space and time defined by a polygon approximating the Danube river flood in Austria between 6(th) and 9(th) August 2002\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E92(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises types that stand as the models for instances of E22 Human-Made Object that are produced as the result of production activities using plans exact enough to result in one or more series of uniform, functionally and aesthetically identical and interchangeable items. The product type is the intended ideal form of the manufacture process. It is typical of instances of E22 Human-Made Object that conform to an instance of E99 Product Type that its component parts are interchangeable with component parts of other instances of E22 Human-Made Object made after the model of the same instance of E99 Product Type. Frequently, the uniform production according to a given instance of E99 Product Type is achieved by creating individual tools, such as moulds or print plates that are themselves carriers of the design of the product type. Modern tools may use the flexibility of electronically controlled devices to achieve such uniformity. The product type itself, i.e. the potentially unlimited series of aesthetically equivalent items, may be the target of artistic design, rather than the individual object. In extreme cases, only one instance of a product type may have been produced, such as in a “print on demand” process which was only triggered once. However, this should not be confused with industrial prototypes, such as car prototypes, which are produced prior to the production line being set up, or test the production line itself.\n\nExamples:\n- Volkswagen Type 11 [Beetle] (Rieger, 2013)\n- Dragendorff 54 samian vessel\n- 1937 Edward VIII brass threepenny bit \n- Qin Crossbow trigger un-notched Part B (Bg2u) (Li, 2012)\n- Nokia Cityman 1320 [The first Nokia mobile phone]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E99(x) ⇒ E55(x)\n

comment: Quantification: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property identifies an instance E90 Symbolic Object carried by an instance of E18 Physical Thing. Since an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is defined as an immaterial idealization over potentially multiple carriers, any individual realization on a particular physical carrier may be defective, due to deterioration or shortcomings in the process of creating the realization compared to the intended ideal. As long as such defects do not substantially affect the complete recognition of the respective symbolic object, it is still regarded as carrying an instance of this E90 Symbolic Object. If these defects are of scholarly interest, the particular realization can be modelled as an instance of E25 Human-Made Feature. Note, that any instance of E90 Symbolic Object incorporated (P165) in the carried symbolic object is also carried by the same instance of E18 Physical Thing.\n\nExamples:\n- Matthew’s paperback copy of Reach for the Sky (E18) carries the text of Reach for the Sky (E73).

comment: Quantification: many to one (0,1:0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property describes the largest volume in space, an instance of E53 Place, that an instance of E18 Physical Thing has occupied at any time during its existence, with respect to the reference space relative to the physical thing itself. This allows for describing the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. The reference space for the associated place must be the one that is permanently at rest (P157 is at rest relative to) relative to the physical thing. For instances of E19 Physical Objects it is the one which is at rest relative to the object itself, i.e., which moves together with the object. For instances of E26 Physical Feature it is one which is at rest relative to the physical feature itself and the surrounding matter immediately connected to it. Therefore, there is a 1:1 relation between the instance E18 Physical Thing and the instance of E53 Place it occupies. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces. \nThis property implies the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place. However, in contrast to P156 occupies, the property P161 has spatial projection does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place. \nIn contrast to P156 occupies, for the property P53 has former or current location the following holds: \nIt does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place. \nIt identifies a possibly wider instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time-span. \nIf the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place is not at rest with respect to the physical thing found there, the physical thing may move away after some time to another place and/or may have been at some other place before. The same holds for the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place.\n\nExamples:\n- The Saint Titus reliquary (E22) occupies the space of the Saint Titus reliquary (E53). [The reliquary is currently kept in the Saint Titus Church in Heraklion, Crete since 1966 and contains the skull of Saint Titus.] (Fisher & Garvey, 2010)\n- Burg Eltz near Koblenz, Germany (E24) occupies the space within the 1661AD outer walls of Burg Eltz (E53). [The castle (English name: Eltz Castle) underwent a series of expansions starting in the 12(th) century until it reached its current extent in 1661AD and contains buildings from various periods.]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P156(x,y) ⇒ E53(y)\n- P156(x,y) ⇒ E18(x)\n- P156(x,y) ⇔ (∃z) [E18(x) ∧ E53(y) ∧ P196(x,z) ∧ P161(z,y) ∧ P157(y,x)]\n

comment: Quantification: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property associates an instance of E73 Information Object with an instance of E90 Symbolic Object (or any of its subclasses) that was included in it.\nThis property makes it possible to recognise the autonomous status of the incorporated signs, which were created in a distinct context, and can be incorporated in many instances of E73 Information Object, and to highlight the difference between structural and accidental whole-part relationships between conceptual entities.\nIt accounts for many cultural facts that are quite frequent and significant: the inclusion of a poem in an anthology, the re-use of an operatic aria in a new opera, the use of a reproduction of a painting for a book cover or a CD booklet, the integration of textual quotations, the presence of lyrics in a song that sets those lyrics to music, the presence of the text of a play in a movie based on that play, etc.\nIn particular, this property allows for modelling relationships of different levels of symbolic specificity, such as the natural language words making up a particular text, the characters making up the words and punctuation, the choice of fonts and page layout for the characters.\nWhen restricted to information objects, that is, seen as a property with E73 Information Object as domain and range the property is transitive.\nA digital photograph of a manuscript page incorporates the text of a manuscript page, if the respective text is defined as a sequence of symbols of a particular type, such as Latin characters, and the resolution and quality of the digital image is sufficient to resolve these symbols so they are readable on the digital image.\nThis property is asymmetric.\n\nExamples:\n- The content of Charles-Moïse Briquet’s ‘Les Filigranes: dictionnaire historique des marques du papier’ (E32) incorporates the visual aspect of the watermark used around 1358-61 by some Spanish papermaker(s) and identified as ‘Briquet 4019’ (E37). (Briquet, 1985)\n- The visual content of Jacopo Amigoni’s painting known as ‘The Singer Farinelli and friends’ (E36) incorporates the musical notation of Farinelli’s musical work entitled ‘La Partenza’ (E73). (National Gallery of Victoria)\n- The visual content of Nicolas Poussin’s painting entitled ‘Les Bergers d’Arcadie’ (E36) incorporates the Latin phrase ‘Et in Arcadia ego’ (E33).

comment: Quantification: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property associates an instance of E53 Place with another instance of E53 Place, which is defined in the same reference space, and which is used to approximate the former. The property does not necessarily state the quality or accuracy of this approximation, but rather indicates the use of the first instance of place to approximate the second.\nIn common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g. in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g. if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place. In this case the stated “phenomenal” place found in the documentation can be seen as an approximation of the actual encounter spot without more specific knowledge. \nIn more recent documentation often point coordinate information is provided that originates from GPS measurements or georeferencing from a map. This point coordinate information does not state the actual place of the encounter spot but tries to approximate it with a “declarative” place. The accuracy depends on the methodology used when creating the coordinates. It may be dependent on technical limitations like GPS accuracy but also on the method where the GPS location is taken in relation to the measured feature. If the methodology is known a maximum deviation from the measured point can be calculated and the encounter spot or feature may be related to the resulting circle using an instance of P171 at some place within.\nThis property is not transitive. This property is reflexive.\n\nExamples:\n- [40°31'17.9"N 21°15'48.3"E] (E53) approximates Kastoria, Greece, TGN ID: 7010880 (E53).

This real spatiotemporal extent of the instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded as being unique, in all its details and fuzziness; the identity and existence of the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume depend uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing, whose existence defines it. It constitutes a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013).\nIncluded in this spacetime volume are both the spaces filled by the matter of the physical thing and any inner space that may exist, for instance the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a finite number of individually contiguous subsets of this spacetime volume equal to the number of objects that constitute the set and that are never connected during its existence.\n\nExamples:\n- H.M.S. Temeraire (E22) defines the spacetime volume of H.M.S. Temeraire (E92). [it was built, during 1798, in Chatham and destroyed, during 1838, in Rotherhithe] (Willis, 2010)\n- The Saint Titus reliquary (E22) defines the spacetime volume of the Saint Titus reliquary (E92).

comment: Quantification of the inverse property: many to many, necessary (1,n:0,n)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property describes the spatial location of an instance of E4 Period. \nThe related instance of E53 Place should be seen as a wider approximation of the geometric area within which the phenomena that characterise the period in question occurred, see below. P7 took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (frequently on the surface of the earth). For example, the period “Révolution française” can be said to have taken place in “France in 1789”; the “Victorian” period may be said to have taken place in “Britain from 1837-1901” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.\nAny place where something happened includes the spatial projection of the happening given in the same geometric reference system. For instance, HMS Victory, as place of Lord Nelson's dying, includes the location of his body relative to the hull of HMS Victory at his time of death as the most precise location of his death. By the definition of P161 has spatial projection, an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections to respective reference systems, that is, instances of E53 Place. Therefore, this property implies the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within to E53 Place, where both places are defined in the same geometric reference system. The relation between an instance of E53 Place and its reference system can conveniently be documented via the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).\nSomething that has happened at a given place can also be considered to have happened at a smaller place within it: for example, it is reasonable to say Caesar’s murder took place in Rome, but also on the Forum Romanum, and more precisely in the Curia. It is characteristic for different historical sources to use varying precision in such statements, without being in contradiction with each other. This may be due to lack of knowledge or to the relevance of the precision for the purpose of the statement. In information integration, the more precise statement improves the overall knowledge.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The period “Révolution française” (E4) took place at the area covered by France in 1789 (E53). (Bertaud, 2004)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ E4(x)\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ E53(y)\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ (∃z,u) [P157(y,u) ˄ P157(z,u) ˄ P161(x,z) ˄ P89(z,y)]\n- [E4(x) ˄ P157(y,u) ˄ P157(v,u) ˄ P7(x,y) ˄ P161(x,z) ˄ P89(z,v) ˄ P89(v,y)] ⇒ P7(x,v)\n

comment: Quantification of the inverse property: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property describes the location of an instance of E4 Period with respect to an instance of E18 Physical Thing. \nThis property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P7 took place at, E53 Place, P156i is occupied by to E18 Physical Thing.\nIt describes a period that can be located with respect to the space defined by an E19 Physical Object such as a ship or a building. The precise geographical location of the object during the period in question may be unknown or unimportant. \nFor example, the French and German armistice of 22(nd) June 1940 was signed in the same railway carriage as the armistice of 11(th) November 1918.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The coronation of Queen Elizabeth II (E7) took place on or within Westminster Abbey (E18). (Strong, 2005)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P8(x,y) ⇒ E4(x)\n- P8(x,y) ⇒ E18(y)\n- P8(x,y) ⇐ (∃z) [E53(z) ˄ P7(x,z) ˄ P156i(z,y)]\n

comment: Quantification of the inverse property: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property identifies an instance E90 Symbolic Object carried by an instance of E18 Physical Thing. Since an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is defined as an immaterial idealization over potentially multiple carriers, any individual realization on a particular physical carrier may be defective, due to deterioration or shortcomings in the process of creating the realization compared to the intended ideal. As long as such defects do not substantially affect the complete recognition of the respective symbolic object, it is still regarded as carrying an instance of this E90 Symbolic Object. If these defects are of scholarly interest, the particular realization can be modelled as an instance of E25 Human-Made Feature. Note, that any instance of E90 Symbolic Object incorporated (P165) in the carried symbolic object is also carried by the same instance of E18 Physical Thing.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- Matthew’s paperback copy of Reach for the Sky (E18) carries the text of Reach for the Sky (E73). [see also: (Brickhill, 2001)] (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P128(x,y) ⇒ E18(x)\n- P128(x,y) ⇒ E90(y) \n- P128(x,y) ⇒ P130(x,y)\n

comment: Quantification: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property generalises the notions of “copy of” and “similar to” into a directed relationship, where the domain expresses the derivative or influenced item and the range the source or influencing item, if such a direction can be established. The property can also be used to express similarity in cases that can be stated between two objects only, without historical knowledge about its reasons. The property expresses a symmetric relationship in case no direction of influence can be established either from evidence on the item itself or from historical knowledge. This holds in particular for siblings of a derivation process from a common source or non-causal cultural parallels, such as some weaving patterns.\nThe P130.1 kind of similarity property of the P130 shows features of (features are also found on) property enables the relationship between the domain and the range to be further clarified, in the sense from domain to range, if applicable. For example, it may be expressed if both items are product “of the same mould”, or if two texts “contain identical paragraphs”. \nIf the reason for similarity is a sort of derivation process, i.e. that the creator has used or had in mind the form of a particular thing during the creation or production, this process should be explicitly modelled. In these cases, P130 shows features of can be regarded as a shortcut of such a process. However, the current model does not contain any path specific enough to infer this property. Specializations of the CIDOC CRM may however be more explicit, for instance describing the use of moulds etc.\nThis property is not transitive. This property is irreflexive.\n\nExamples:\n- Mary Lamb’s Cymbeline from Charles and Mary Lamb’s Tales from Shakespeare (E89) shows features of William Shakespeare’s Cymbeline (E89). (Carrington, 1954)\n- The audio recording of Dante Alighieri’s La divina commedia read by Enrico de Negri (E73) shows features of the text of Dante Alighieri’s La divina commedia (E89).

comment: Quantification of the inverse property: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property associates two instances of E7 Activity, where the domain is considered as an intentional continuation of the range. A continuation of an activity may happen when the continued activity is still ongoing or after the continued activity has completely ended. The continuing activity may have started already before it decided to continue the other one. Continuation implies a coherence of intentions and outcomes of the involved activities.\nThis property is not transitive. This property is asymmetric.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The construction of the Kölner Dom (Cologne Cathedral), abandoned in the 15(th) century (E7), was continued by construction in the 19(th) century (E7).

comment: Quantification of the inverse property: one to many, necessary (1,n:0,1)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property links an instance of E6 Destruction to an instance of E18 Physical Thing that has been destroyed by it. \nDestruction implies the end of an item’s life as a subject of cultural documentation – the physical matter of which the item was composed may in fact continue to exist. An instance of E6 Destruction may be contiguous with an instance of E12 Production that brings into existence a derived object composed partly of matter from the destroyed object.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The Tay Bridge Disaster (E6) destroyed the Tay Bridge (E22). (Thomas, 1972)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P13(x,y) ⇒ E6 (x)\n- P13(x,y) ⇒ E18(y) \n- P13(x,y) ⇒ P93(x,y)\n

(Iliffe, 2013)\n- George Washington’s leaving office in 1797 (E86) separated from the office of President of the United States (E74). (Unger, 2015)\n- The implementation of the treaty regulating the termination of Greenland membership in EU between EU, Denmark and Greenland 1(st) February 1985 (E86) separated from EU (E74).\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P146(x,y) ⇒ E86(x)\n- P146(x,y) ⇒ E74(y) \n- P146(x,y) ⇒ P11(x,y)\n

comment: Quantification of the inverse property: many to one (0,1:0,n)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property describes the largest volume in space, an instance of E53 Place, that an instance of E18 Physical Thing has occupied at any time during its existence, with respect to the reference space relative to the physical thing itself. This allows for describing the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. The reference space for the associated place must be the one that is permanently at rest (P157 is at rest relative to) relative to the physical thing. For instances of E19 Physical Objects it is the one which is at rest relative to the object itself, i.e., which moves together with the object. For instances of E26 Physical Feature it is one which is at rest relative to the physical feature itself and the surrounding matter immediately connected to it. Therefore, there is a 1:1 relation between the instance E18 Physical Thing and the instance of E53 Place it occupies. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces. \nThis property implies the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place. However, in contrast to P156 occupies, the property P161 has spatial projection does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place. \nIn contrast to P156 occupies, for the property P53 has former or current location the following holds: \nIt does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place. \nIt identifies a possibly wider instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time-span. \nIf the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place is not at rest with respect to the physical thing found there, the physical thing may move away after some time to another place and/or may have been at some other place before. The same holds for the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The Saint Titus reliquary (E22) occupies the space of the Saint Titus reliquary (E53). [The reliquary is currently kept in the Saint Titus Church in Heraklion, Crete since 1966 and contains the skull of Saint Titus.] (Fisher & Garvey, 2010)\n- Burg Eltz near Koblenz, Germany (E24) occupies the space within the 1661AD outer walls of Burg Eltz (E53). [The castle (English name: Eltz Castle) underwent a series of expansions starting in the 12(th) century until it reached its current extent in 1661AD and contains buildings from various periods.]\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P156(x,y) ⇒ E53(y)\n- P156(x,y) ⇒ E18(x)\n- P156(x,y) ⇔ (∃z) [E18(x) ∧ E53(y) ∧ P196(x,z) ∧ P161(z,y) ∧ P157(y,x)]\n

comment: Quantification: many to many, necessary(1,n:0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property associates an instance of E53 Place with the instance of E18 Physical Thing that determines a reference space for this instance of E53 Place by being at rest with respect to this reference space. The relative stability of form of an instance of E18 Physical Thing defines its default reference space. The reference space is not spatially limited to the referred thing. For example, a ship determines a reference space in terms of which other ships in its neighbourhood may be described.

comment: Quantification of the inverse property: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property associates an instance of E73 Information Object with an instance of E90 Symbolic Object (or any of its subclasses) that was included in it.\nThis property makes it possible to recognise the autonomous status of the incorporated signs, which were created in a distinct context, and can be incorporated in many instances of E73 Information Object, and to highlight the difference between structural and accidental whole-part relationships between conceptual entities.\nIt accounts for many cultural facts that are quite frequent and significant: the inclusion of a poem in an anthology, the re-use of an operatic aria in a new opera, the use of a reproduction of a painting for a book cover or a CD booklet, the integration of textual quotations, the presence of lyrics in a song that sets those lyrics to music, the presence of the text of a play in a movie based on that play, etc.\nIn particular, this property allows for modelling relationships of different levels of symbolic specificity, such as the natural language words making up a particular text, the characters making up the words and punctuation, the choice of fonts and page layout for the characters.\nWhen restricted to information objects, that is, seen as a property with E73 Information Object as domain and range the property is transitive.\nA digital photograph of a manuscript page incorporates the text of a manuscript page, if the respective text is defined as a sequence of symbols of a particular type, such as Latin characters, and the resolution and quality of the digital image is sufficient to resolve these symbols so they are readable on the digital image.\nThis property is asymmetric.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The content of Charles-Moïse Briquet’s ‘Les Filigranes: dictionnaire historique des marques du papier’ (E32) incorporates the visual aspect of the watermark used around 1358-61 by some Spanish papermaker(s) and identified as ‘Briquet 4019’ (E37). (Briquet, 1985)\n- The visual content of Jacopo Amigoni’s painting known as ‘The Singer Farinelli and friends’ (E36) incorporates the musical notation of Farinelli’s musical work entitled ‘La Partenza’ (E73). (National Gallery of Victoria)\n- The visual content of Nicolas Poussin’s painting entitled ‘Les Bergers d’Arcadie’ (E36) incorporates the Latin phrase ‘Et in Arcadia ego’ (E33).

comment: Quantification: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property describes the use of material or immaterial things in a way essential to the performance or the outcome of an instance of E7 Activity. \nThis property typically applies to tools, instruments, moulds, raw materials and items embedded in a product. It implies that the presence of the object in question was a necessary condition for the action. For example, the activity of writing this text required the use of a computer. An immaterial thing can be used if at least one of its carriers is present.

comment: Quantification of the inverse property: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property describes the use of material or immaterial things in a way essential to the performance or the outcome of an instance of E7 Activity. \nThis property typically applies to tools, instruments, moulds, raw materials and items embedded in a product.

comment: Quantification of the inverse property: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property specifies that the temporal extent of the domain instance A of E2 Temporal Entity starts definitely before the start of the temporal extent of the range instance B of E2 Temporal Entity. \nIn other words, if A = [A(start), A(end)] and B = [B(start), B(end)], it means A(start) < B(start) is true. \nThis property is part of the set of temporal primitives P173 – P176, P182 – P185.\nThis property corresponds to a disjunction (logical OR) of the following Allen temporal relations (Allen, 1983): \{before, meets, overlaps, contains, finished-by\}. This property is transitive. This property is asymmetric.\n\n\nhttps://cidoc-crm.org/html/version_images/images_7.1.3/image_07.png\n\n\nFigure 14: Temporal entity A starts before the start of temporal entity B.

Here A is shorter than B\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The reign of King Harold II (E4) starts before the start of the Battle of Hastings (E7). (Wikipedia 2022a)\n- The life of Attila “the Hun” (E4) starts before the start of the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (E7). [June 20, 451 AD] (Wikipedia 2022b)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P176(x,y) ⇒ E2(x)\n- P176(x,y) ⇒ E2(y)\n- P176(x,y) ⇒ P175(x,y)\n- [P176(x,y) ∧ P176(y,z)] ⇒ P176(x,z)\n- P176(x,y) ⇒ ¬P176(y,x)\n

The property does not necessarily state the quality or accuracy of this approximation, but rather indicates the use of the first instance of place to approximate the second.\nIn common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g. in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g. if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place. In this case the stated “phenomenal” place found in the documentation can be seen as an approximation of the actual encounter spot without more specific knowledge. \nIn more recent documentation often point coordinate information is provided that originates from GPS measurements or georeferencing from a map. This point coordinate information does not state the actual place of the encounter spot but tries to approximate it with a “declarative” place. The accuracy depends on the methodology used when creating the coordinates. It may be dependent on technical limitations like GPS accuracy but also on the method where the GPS location is taken in relation to the measured feature. If the methodology is known a maximum deviation from the measured point can be calculated and the encounter spot or feature may be related to the resulting circle using an instance of P171 at some place within.\nThis property is not transitive. This property is reflexive.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- [40°31'17.9"N 21°15'48.3"E] (E53) approximates Kastoria, Greece, TGN ID: 7010880 (E53). [The approximating declarative place with point shape is defined in terms of coordinates taken from https://sws.geonames.org/735927]\n- [40°31'00.1"N 21°16'00.1"E] (E53) approximates Kastoria, Greece, TGN ID: 7010880 (E53). [The approximating declarative place with point shape is defined in terms of coordinates taken from http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/7010880]\n- [40°04'60.0"N 22°21'00.0"E] (E53) approximates Mount Olympus National Park, Greece (E53).

comment: Quantification of the inverse property: one to one, necessary (1,1:0,1)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property associates an instance of E18 Physical Thing with the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume that constitutes the complete trajectory of its geometric extent through spacetime for the whole time of the existence of the instance of E18 Physical Thing.\nAn instance of E18 Physical Thing not only occupies a particular geometric space at each instant of its existence, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime, i.e. the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume this property associates it with. This real spatiotemporal extent of the instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded as being unique, in all its details and fuzziness; the identity and existence of the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume depend uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing, whose existence defines it. It constitutes a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013).\nIncluded in this spacetime volume are both the spaces filled by the matter of the physical thing and any inner space that may exist, for instance the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a finite number of individually contiguous subsets of this spacetime volume equal to the number of objects that constitute the set and that are never connected during its existence.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- H.M.S. Temeraire (E22) defines the spacetime volume of H.M.S. Temeraire (E92). [it was built, during 1798, in Chatham and destroyed, during 1838, in Rotherhithe] (Willis, 2010)\n- The Saint Titus reliquary (E22) defines the spacetime volume of the Saint Titus reliquary (E92). [the reliquary has been produced by the workshop of the Vogiatzis brothers located at Monastiraki, Athens, in 1966 as container for the skull of Saint Titus, which was placed into it at that time and has since then continued to fall within the container’s spacetime volume. The reliquary with the skull has been kept in the Saint Titus Church in Heraklion, Crete since 1966] (Fisher & Garvey, 2010; Panotis, 2016)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P196(x,y) ⇒ E18(x)\n- P196(x,y) ⇒ E92(y)\n

comment: Quantification: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property describes the naming or identification of any real-world item by a name or any other identifier. \nThis property is intended for identifiers in general use, which form part of the world the model intends to describe, and not merely for internal database identifiers which are specific to a technical system, unless these latter also have a more general use outside the technical context. This property includes in particular identification by mathematical expressions such as coordinate systems used for the identification of instances of E53 Place. The property does not reveal anything about when, where and by whom this identifier was used. A more detailed representation can be made using the fully developed (i.e. indirect) path through E15 Identifier Assignment.\nThis property is a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P140i was attributed by, E15 Identifier Assignment, P37 assigned to E42 Identifier. \nIt is also a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P1 is identified by, E41 Appellation, P139 has alternative form to E41 Appellation.\n\nExamples:\n- The capital of Italy (E53) is identified by “Rome” (E41). (Leach, 2017)\n- Text 25014–32 (E33) is identified by “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” (E35). (Gibbon, 2013)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P1(x,y) ⇒ E1(x)\n- P1(x,y) ⇒ E41(y)\n- P1(x,y) ⇐ (∃z) [E15(z)˄ P140i(x,z) ˄ P37(z,y)]\n- P1(x,y) ⇐ (∃z) [E41(z)˄ P1(x,z) ˄ P139(z,y)]\n

comment: Quantification: many to many, necessary (1,n:0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property records the dimension that was observed in an E16 Measurement Event.\nE54 Dimension can be any quantifiable aspect of E70 Thing. Weight, image colour depth and monetary value are dimensions in this sense. One measurement activity may determine more than one dimension of one object.\nDimensions may be determined either by direct observation or using recorded evidence. In the latter case the measured Thing does not need to be present or extant.\nEven though knowledge of the value of a dimension requires measurement, the dimension may be an object of discourse prior to, or even without, any measurement being made.\n\nExamples:\n- The measurement of the height of silver cup 232 on 31(st) August 1997 (E16) observed dimension silver cup 232 height (E54).

comment: Quantification of the inverse property: many to many, necessary (1,n:0,n)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property records the dimension that was observed in an E16 Measurement Event.\nE54 Dimension can be any quantifiable aspect of E70 Thing. Weight, image colour depth and monetary value are dimensions in this sense. One measurement activity may determine more than one dimension of one object.\nDimensions may be determined either by direct observation or using recorded evidence. In the latter case the measured Thing does not need to be present or extant.\nEven though knowledge of the value of a dimension requires measurement, the dimension may be an object of discourse prior to, or even without, any measurement being made.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The measurement of the height of silver cup 232 on 31(st) August 1997 (E16) observed dimension silver cup 232 height (E54). [which has unit mm (E58), has value 224 (E60)] (fictitious)\n- The carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 (E16) observed dimension the carbon 14 based temporal distance from 1996 to the growth of the wood of the “Schoeninger Speer II” (E60).

This area may either be identified by a name, or by a geometry in terms of a coordinate system adapted to the shape of the respective instance of E18 Physical Thing. Typically, names identifying sections of physical objects are composed of the name of a kind of part and the name of the object itself, such as “The poop deck of H.M.S. Victory”, which is composed of “poop deck” and “H.M.S. Victory”.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- HMS Victory (E22) has section HMS Victory section B347.6 (E53). (Goodwin, 2015)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P59(x,y) ⇒ E18(x)\n- P59(x,y) ⇒ E53(y)\n

comment: Quantification of the inverse property: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property identifies something that is depicted by an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing. Depicting is meant in the sense that an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing intentionally shows, through its optical qualities or form, a representation of the entity depicted. Photographs are by default regarded as being intentional in this sense. Anything that is designed to change the properties of the depiction, such as an e-book reader, is specifically excluded. The property does not pertain to inscriptions or any other information encoding.\nThis property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E24 Physical Human-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item, E36 Visual Item, P138 represents to E1 CRM Entity. P62.1 mode of depiction allows the nature of the depiction to be refined.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The painting “La Liberté guidant le peuple” by Eugène Delacroix (E22) depicts the French “July Revolution” of 1830 (E7). (Delacroix, 1982)\n- The 20 pence coin held by the Department of Coins and Medals of the British Museum under registration number 2006,1101.126 (E22) depicts Queen Elizabeth II (E21) mode of depiction Profile (E55).\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P62(x,y) ⇒ E24(x)\n- P62(x,y) ⇒ E1(y) \n- P62(x,y,z) ⇒ [P62(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]\n- P62(x,y) ⇐ (∃z) [E36(z) ˄ P65(x,z) ˄ P138(z,y)]\n

However, P65 shows visual item (is shown by) differs from the P62 depicts (is depicted by) property in that it makes no claims about what the instance of E36 Visual Item is deemed to represent.

P65 shows visual item (is shown by) can be used to refer to a particular portrait.\nP65 shows visual item (is shown by) may also be used for Visual Items such as signs, marks and symbols, for example the 'Maltese Cross' or the 'copyright symbol’ that have no particular representational content. \nThis property is part of the fully developed path E24 Physical Human-Made Thing, P65 shows visual item, E36 Visual Item, P138 represents to E1 CRM Entity which is shortcut by, P62 depicts (is depicted by).\n\nExamples:\n- My T-Shirt (E22) shows visual item Mona Lisa (E36).

The P69.1 has type property of P69 has association with allows the nature of the association to be specified reading from domain to range; examples of types of association between instances of E29 Design or Procedure include: has part, follows, requires, etc.\nInstances of this property are considered to be symmetric, in case no directed sense is provided for them by the property P69.1 has type.\nThe property can typically be used to model the decomposition of the description of a complete workflow into a series of separate procedures.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The procedure for glass blowing (E29) has association with the procedure for glass heating (E29). (Brooks, 1973)\n- The set of instructions for performing Macbeth in Max Reinhardt's production in 1916 in Berlin at Deutsches Theater (E29) has association with the scene design drawing by Ernst Stern reproduced at http://www.glopad.org/pi/fr/record/digdoc/1003814 (E29) has type has part (E55).\n- The preparation of parchment (E29) has association with soaking and unhairing of skin (E29) has type has part (E55).\n- Stretching of skin (E29) has association with soaking and unhairing of skin (E29) has type follows (E55). (Poole and Reed, 1962)\n- The plan for reassembling the temples at Abu Simbel (E29) has association with the plan for storing and transporting the blocks (E29) has type follows (E55). (Loubiere, 1995)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P69(x,y) ⇒ E29(x)\n- P69(x,y) ⇒ E29(y)\n- P69(x,y,z) ⇒ [P69(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]\n

comment: Quantification: many to many, necessary (1,n:0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property describes the spatial location of an instance of E4 Period. \nThe related instance of E53 Place should be seen as a wider approximation of the geometric area within which the phenomena that characterise the period in question occurred, see below. P7 took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (frequently on the surface of the earth). For example, the period “Révolution française” can be said to have taken place in “France in 1789”; the “Victorian” period may be said to have taken place in “Britain from 1837-1901” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.\nAny place where something happened includes the spatial projection of the happening given in the same geometric reference system. For instance, HMS Victory, as place of Lord Nelson's dying, includes the location of his body relative to the hull of HMS Victory at his time of death as the most precise location of his death. By the definition of P161 has spatial projection, an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections to respective reference systems, that is, instances of E53 Place. Therefore, this property implies the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within to E53 Place, where both places are defined in the same geometric reference system. The relation between an instance of E53 Place and its reference system can conveniently be documented via the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).\nSomething that has happened at a given place can also be considered to have happened at a smaller place within it: for example, it is reasonable to say Caesar’s murder took place in Rome, but also on the Forum Romanum, and more precisely in the Curia. It is characteristic for different historical sources to use varying precision in such statements, without being in contradiction with each other. This may be due to lack of knowledge or to the relevance of the precision for the purpose of the statement. In information integration, the more precise statement improves the overall knowledge.\n\nExamples:\n- The period “Révolution française” (E4) took place at the area covered by France in 1789 (E53). (Bertaud, 2004)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ E4(x)\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ E53(y)\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ (∃z,u) [P157(y,u) ˄ P157(z,u) ˄ P161(x,z) ˄ P89(z,y)]\n- [E4(x) ˄ P157(y,u) ˄ P157(v,u) ˄ P7(x,y) ˄ P161(x,z) ˄ P89(z,v) ˄ P89(v,y)] ⇒ P7(x,v)\n

It addresses temporal containment only, and no contextual link between the two instances of E52 Time-Span is implied. This property is transitive and reflexive.\n\nExamples:\n- The time-span of the Apollo 11 moon mission (E52) falls within the time-span of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II (E52). (Riley, 2009; Robinson, 2000)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P86(x,y) ⇒ E52(x) \n- P86(x,y) ⇒ E52(y)\n- [P86(x,y) ∧ P86(y,z)] ⇒ P86(x,z)\n- P86(x,x)\n
