The recording of the donor or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E10 Transfer of Custody there is either no donor or no recipient. \nDepending on the circumstances, it may describe: \n1. the beginning of custody (there is no previous custodian)\n2. the end of custody (there is no subsequent custodian)\n3. the transfer of custody (transfer from one custodian to the next)\n4. the receipt of custody from an unknown source (the previous custodian is unknown)\n5. the declared loss of an object (the current or subsequent custodian is unknown)\nIn the event that only a single kind of transfer of custody occurs, either the legal responsibility for the custody or the actual physical possession of the object but not both, this difference should be expressed using the property \nP2 has type (is type of).\nThe sense of physical possession requires that the object of custody be in the hands of the keeper at least with a part representative for the whole. The way, in which a representative part is defined, should ensure that it is unambiguous who keeps a part and who the whole and should be consistent with the identity criteria of the kept instance of E18 Physical Thing.\nThe interpretation of the museum notion of \"accession\" differs between institutions. The CIDOC CRM therefore models legal ownership and physical custody separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these. \nTheft is a specific case of illegal transfer of custody.\n\nExamples:\n- the delivery of the paintings by Secure Deliveries Inc. to the National Gallery\n- the return of Picasso’s “Guernica” to Madrid’s Prado in 1981 (Chipp, 1988)\n- the transfer of custody of the work described as “Von der Velden ein Ufer an der See” from Johann Matthäus von Merian to the Auction House Heldevier (Jacob) for the purpose of sale, ca. 1716\n- the transfer of custody of the painting ‘Mrs. Fitzherbert’ to the art dealer Knoedler from Parke-Bernet Galleries (New York, NY, USA) ca.

It also includes the conservation treatment of an object.\nSince the distinction between modification and production is not always clear, modification is regarded as the more generally applicable concept. This implies that some items may be consumed or destroyed in an instance of E11 Modification, and that others may be produced as a result of it. An event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities.\nAn activity undertaken on an object which was designed to alter it, but which, in fact, it did not in any seemingly significant way (such as the application of a solvent during conservation which failed to dissolve any part of the object), is still considered as an instance of E11 Modification. Typically, any such activity will leave at least forensic traces of evidence on the object.\nIf the instance of E29 Design or Procedure utilized for the modification prescribes the use of specific materials, they should be documented using property P68 foresees use of (use foreseen by): E57 Material of E29 Design or Procedure, rather than via P126 employed (was employed in): E57 Material.\n\nExamples:\n- the construction of the SS Great Britain (E12) (Gregor, 1971)\n- the impregnation of the Vasa warship in Stockholm for preservation after 1956 (Håfors, 2010)\n- the transformation of the Enola Gay into a museum exhibit by the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC between 1993 and 1995 (E12, E81) (Yakel, 2000)\n- the last renewal of the gold coating of the Toshogu shrine in Nikko, Japan (Cali and Dougil, 2012)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E11(x) ⇒ E7(x)\n" ],

The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered “new” if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered “new” because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one. \nThis entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event. \nAn event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.\n\nExamples:\n- the construction of the SS Great Britain (Gregor, 1971)\n- the first casting of the Little Mermaid from the harbour of Copenhagen (Dewey, 2003)\n- Rembrandt’s creating of the seventh state of his etching “Woman sitting half dressed beside a stove”, 1658, identified by Bartsch Number 197 (E12, E65, E81) (Hind, 1923)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E12(x) ⇒ E11(x)\n- E12(x) ⇒ E63(x)\n" ],

The type of the property asserted to hold between two items or concepts can be described by the property P177 assigned property of type (is type of property assigned): E55 Type. \nFor example, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain scientific/scholarly procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on whether this information should be accessible by structured queries.\nThis class allows for the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. Note that all instances of properties described in a knowledge base are the opinion of someone. Per default, they are the opinion of the team maintaining the knowledge base. This fact must not individually be registered for all instances of properties provided by the maintaining team, because it would result in an endless recursion of whose opinion was the description of an opinion. Therefore, the use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment marks the fact that the maintaining team is in general neutral to the validity of the respective assertion, but registers someone else’s opinion and how it came about.\nAll properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly relating the respective pair of items or concepts. Multiple use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment may possibly lead to a collection of contradictory values.\n\nExamples:\n- the examination of MS Sinai Greek 418 by Nicholas Pickwoad in November 2003 (Honey & Pickwoad, 2010)\n- the assessment of the current ownership of Martin Doerr’s silver cup in February 1997 (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E13(x) ⇒ E7(x)\n" ],

An instance of E15 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents, which themselves may be instances of E41 Appellation. The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure.\nExamples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when, and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.\nThe fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as “preferred identifier assignment”, to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment through the P2 has type (is type of) property.\n\nExamples:\n- replacement of the inventory number TA959a by GE34604 for a 17(th) century lamentation cloth at the Museum Benaki, Athens\n- assigning the author and uniform title heading “Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832.

        "comments" : [ "Scope note:\nThis class comprises actions measuring physical properties and other values that can be determined by a systematic, objective procedure of direct observation of particular states of physical reality. \nAn instance of E16 Measurement may use simple counting or tools, such as yardsticks or radiation detection devices. The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Methods and devices employed should be associated with instances of E16 Measurement by properties such as P33 used specific technique: E29 Design or Procedure, P125 used object of type: E55 Type, P16 used specific object (was used for): E70 Thing, whereas basic techniques such as \"carbon-14 dating\" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of): E55 Type. Details of methods and devices reused or reusable in other instances of E16 Measurement should be documented for these entities rather than the measurements themselves, whereas details of particular execution may be documented by free text or by instantiating adequate sub-activities, if the detail may be of interest for an overarching query.\nRegardless whether a measurement is made by an instrument or by human senses, it represents the initial transition from physical reality to information without any other documented information object in between within the reasoning chain that would represent the result of the interaction of the observer or device with reality. Therefore, determining properties of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is regarded as an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment, which may be inferred from observing and measuring representative carriers. In the case that the carrier can be named, the property P16 used specific object (was used for) should be used to indicate the instance(s) of E18 Physical Thing that was used as the empirical basis for the attribute assignment. For instance, inferring properties of depicted items using image material, such as satellite images, is not regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement, but as a subsequent instance of E13 Attribute Assignment. Rather, only the production of the images, understood as arrays of radiation intensities, is regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement. The same reasoning holds for other sensor data.\n\nExamples:\n- measurement of the height of silver cup 232 on 31(st) August 1997 (fictitious)\n- the carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 [The carbon 14 dating of an approximately 400.000 year old complete Old Palaeolithic wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niedersachsen, Germany, in 1995.] (Kouwenhoven, 1997)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E16(x) ⇒ E13(x)\n" ],

This class comprises, besides others, human-made objects, such as a sword, and human-made features, such as rock art. For example, a “cup and ring” carving on bedrock is regarded as instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.\nInstances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing may be the result of modifying pre-existing physical things, preserving larger parts or most of the original matter and structure, which poses the question if they are new or even human-made, the respective interventions of production made on such original material should be obvious and sufficient to regard that the product has a new, distinct identity and intended function and is human-made. Substantial continuity of the previous matter and structure in the new product can be documented by describing the production process also as an instance of E81 Transformation.\nWhereas interventions of conservation and repair are not regarded to produce a new instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing, the results of preparation of natural history specimens that substantially change their natural or original state should be regarded as instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Things, including the uncovering of petrified biological features from a solid piece of stone. On the other side, scribbling a museum number on a natural object should not be regarded to make it human-made. This notwithstanding, parts, sections, segments, or features of an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing may continue to be non-human-made and preserved during the production process, for example natural pearls used as a part of an eardrop.\n\nExamples:\n- the Forth Railway Bridge (Shipway, Bouch, Baker and Fowler, 1990).\n- the Channel Tunnel (E25) (Holliday, Marcou and Vickerman, 1991)\n- the Palace of Knossos (Evans, 1921)\n- the Colosseum in Rome, Italy (Hopkins and Beard, 2011)\n- the Historical Collection of the Museum Benaki in Athens (E78) (Georgoula, 2005)\n- the Rosetta Stone (E22)\n- my paperback copy of Crime & Punishment (E22) (fictitious)\n- the computer disk at ICS-FORTH that stores the canonical Definition of the CIDOC CRM v.3.2 (E22)\n- my empty DVD disk (E22) (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E24(x) ⇒ E18(x)\n- E24(x) ⇒ E71(x)\n" ],

In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue.

Their existence ends when the last carrier and the last memory are lost.\n\nExamples:\n- Beethoven’s “Ode an die Freude” (Ode to Joy) (E73) (Kershaw, 1999)\n- the definition of “ontology” in the Oxford English Dictionary (E73) (Oxford University Press, 1989)\n- the knowledge about the victory at Marathon carried by the famous runner (E89) (Lagos & Karyanos, 2020)\n- [Explanation note: The following examples illustrate the distinction between a propositional object, its names and its encoded forms. The Maxwell equations (Ball, 1962) are a good example, because they belong to the fundamental laws of physics and their mathematical content yields identical, unambiguous results regardless formulation and encoding.] \n- “Maxwell equations” (E41) [preferred subject access point from LCSH, http://lccn.loc.gov/sh85082387, accessed 18(th) April 2021.

The size, orientation, and colour may change, but the logo remains uniquely identifiable. The same is true of images that are reproduced many times.

        "comments" : [ "Scope note:\nThis class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.\nIt is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an instance of E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.\nOften, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore, E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical birth, an instance of E67 Birth, can be seen as both a single event, i.e. an instance of E5 Event, and as an extended period, i.e. an instance of E4 Period, that consists of multiple physical processes and complementary activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\nE4 Period is a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime Volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CIDOC CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance, it is possible to discuss the physical extent of an instance of E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomenon while an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore, this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\nTypical use of this class in cultural heritage documentation is for documenting cultural and artistic periods. There are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period in the European sphere of influence lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\nA geopolitical unit as a specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena related to the claim of power, the consequences of belonging to a jurisdictional area and an administrative system that establishes a geopolitical unit. Examples from the modern period are countries or administrative areas of countries such as districts whose actions and structures define activities and phenomena in the area that they intend to govern. The borders of geopolitical units are often defined in contracts or treaties although they may deviate from the actual practice. The spatiotemporal properties of Geopolitical units can be modelled through the properties inherited from E92 Spacetime Volume.\nAnother specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the actual extent of the set of activities and phenomena as evidenced by their physical traces that define a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n\nExamples:\n- Jurassic (Hallam, 1975)\n- Populated Period of Nineveh\n- Imperial Rome under Marcus Aurelius\n- European Bronze Age (Harrison, 2004) \n- Italian Renaissance (Macdonald, 1992)\n- Thirty Years War (Lee, 1991)\n- Sturm und Drang (Berkoff, 2013)\n- Cubism (Cox, 2000)\n- The Capital of Russia (E4) [the capital of Russia in the sense of an administrative unit moved in historical times from Moscow to St Petersburg and then back to Moscow. This exemplifies an administrative unit changing place over time without temporal discontinuity]\n- The settling activity of the community of Helsinki (a.k.a. Helsingfors) (E7) [the original settlement called Helsinki was located in the area of the modern airport. The community moved later to settle on the coast. This exemplifies a continued activity changing place over time without temporal discontinuity]\n- Bronze Age (E4) [Bronze Age, in the sense of technological adoption, spread over disjoint areas including islands such as the British Isles without temporal discontinuity]\n- Japan, the state (E4) [In 2021, the Japanese state as a political unit comprised in 6852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E4(x) ⇒ E2(x)\n- E4(x) ⇒ E92(x)\n" ],

The actual extent of an instance of E52 Time-Span can be approximated by properties of E52 Time-Span giving inner and outer bounds in the form of dates (instances of E61 Time Primitive). Comparing knowledge about time-spans is fundamental for chronological reasoning.\nSome instances of E52 Time-Span may be defined as the actual, in principle observable, temporal extent of instances of E2 Temporal Entity via the property P4 has time-span (is time-span of): E52 Time-Span. They constitute phenomenal time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013). Since our knowledge of history is imperfect and physical phenomena are fuzzy in nature, the extent of phenomenal time-spans can only be described in approximation. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an instance of E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. It may, nevertheless, be associated with other descriptions by which people can infer knowledge about it, such as in relative chronologies.\nSome instances of E52 may be defined precisely as representing a declaration of a temporal extent, as, for instance, done in a business contract.

Geometrically, instances of E53 Place constitute single contiguous areas or a finite aggregation of disjoint areas in space which are each individually contiguous. They may have fuzzy boundaries.\nThe instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks, but may also be determined by reference to mobile objects. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame.\nIt is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, people are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object, i.e. H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\nAny instance of E18 Physical Thing can serve as a frame of reference for an instance of E53 Place.

The identity of an instance of E54 Dimension depends on the method of its determination because each method may produce different values even when determining comparable qualities. For instance, the wingspan of a bird alive or dead is a different dimension. Thermoluminescence dating and Rehydroxylation [RHX] dating are different dimensions of temporal distance from now, even if they aim at dating the same object. The method of determination should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). Note that simple terms such as “diameter” or “length” are normally insufficient to unambiguously describe a respective dimension. In contrast, “maximum linear extent” may be sufficient.\nThe properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of instances of E54 Dimension adequate to the precision of the applied method of determination. If the respective quantity belongs to a non-discrete space according to the laws of physics, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that comparability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.\nNumerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension, as appropriate.\n\nExamples:\n- the weight of the Luxor Obelisk [250 metric tons]\n- the vertical height of the statue of David by Michelangelo [5.17 metres]\n- the weight of the Great Star of Africa diamond [530.2 carats]\n- the calibrated C14 date for the Shroud of Turin [AD1262-1312, 1303-1384]\n- the horizontal diameter of the Stonehenge Sarsen Circle [33 metres] (Pryor, 2016)\n- the length of the sides of the Great Pyramid at Giza [230.34 metres] (Lehner and Hawass, 2017)\n- the duration of the time-span of the Battle of Issos/Issus on 15(th) November 333 B.C.E.

        "comments" : [ "Scope note:\nThis class comprises distinct, delimited and coherent processes and interactions of a material nature, in cultural, social or physical systems, involving and affecting instances of E77 Persistent Item in a way characteristic of the kind of process. Typical examples are meetings, births, deaths, actions of decision taking, making or inventing things, but also more complex and extended ones such as conferences, elections, building of a castle, or battles.\nWhile the continuous growth of a tree lacks the limits characteristic of an event, its germination from a seed does qualify as an event. Similarly, the blowing of the wind lacks the distinctness and limits of an event, but a hurricane, flood or earthquake would qualify as an event. Mental processes are considered as events, in cases where they are connected with the material externalization of their results; for example, the creation of a poem, a performance or a change of intention that becomes obvious from subsequent actions or declarations.\nThe effects of an instance of E5 Event may not lead to relevant permanent changes of properties or relations of the items involved in it, for example an unrecorded performance. Of course, in order to be documented, some kind of evidence for an event must exist, be it witnesses, traces or products of the event.\nWhile instances of E4 Period always require some form of coherence between its constituent phenomena, in addition, the essential constituents of instances of E5 Event should contribute to an overall effect; for example, the statements made during a meeting and the listening of the audience.\nViewed at a coarse level of detail, an instance of E5 Event may appear as if it had an ‘instantaneous’ overall effect, but any process or interaction of material nature in reality have an extent in time and space. At a fine level, instances of E5 Event may be analysed into component phenomena and phases within a space and timeframe, and as such can be seen as a period, regardless of the size of the phenomena. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy overall effect and are thus not instances of E5 Event.\n\nExamples:\n- the birth of Cleopatra (E67) (Pomeroy, 1984)\n- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD (E6) (Camardo, 2013)\n- World War II (E7) (Barber, 1994)\n- the Battle of Stalingrad (E7) (Hoyt, 1993)\n- the Yalta Conference (E7) (Harbutt, 2010)\n- my birthday celebration 28-6-1995 (E7)\n- the falling of a tile from my roof last Sunday (fictitious)\n- the CIDOC conference 2003 (E7)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E5(x) ⇒ E4(x)\n" ],

Intentional destruction can be documented by classifying the event as both an instance of E6 Destruction and of E7 Activity. \nThe decision to document an object as destroyed, transformed, or modified is context-sensitive: \n1. If the matter remaining from the destruction is not documented, the event is modelled solely as an instance of E6 Destruction. \n2. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the original. In this case, the new items have separate identities. Matter is preserved, but identity is not.\n3. When the initial identity of the changed instance of E18 Physical Thing is preserved, the event should be documented as an instance of E11 Modification.\n\nExamples:\n- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD (Camardo, 2013)\n- the destruction of Nineveh (E6, E7) (River, 2016) \n- the breaking of a champagne glass yesterday by my dog (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E6(x) ⇒ E64(x)\n" ],

Persistent Items may be physical entities, such as people, animals or things, conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or even names. \nInstances of E77 Persistent Item may be present or be part of interactions in different periods or events. They can repeatedly be recognized at disparate occasions during their existence by characteristics of structural nature. The respective characteristics need not be exactly the same during all the existence of an instance of E77 Persistent Item. Often, they undergo gradual change, still bearing some similarities with that of previous times, or disappear completely and new emerge. For instance, a person, from the time of being born on, will gradually change all its features and acquire new ones, such as a scar. Even the DNA in different body cells will develop defects and mutations. Nevertheless, relevant characteristics used should be sufficiently similar to recognize the instance for some substantial period of time. \nThe more specific criteria that determine the identity of instances of subclasses of E77 Persistent Item may vary considerably and are described or referred to in the respective scope notes. The decision about which exact criteria to use depends on whether the observable behaviour of the respective part of reality such confined conforms to the reasoning the user is interested in. For example, a building can be regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria, such as being bodily separated from other persons. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. On the opposite, the identity of a (version of a) text of a scientific publication is given by the exact arrangement of its relevant symbols. \nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope of the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties. \nAn instance of E77 Persistent Item does not require actual knowledge of the identifying features of the instance being currently known. There may be cases, where the actual identifying features of an instance of E77 Persistent Item are not decidable at a particular state of knowledge.\n\nExamples:\n- Leonardo da Vinci (E21) (Strano, 1953)\n- Stonehenge (E24) (Pryor, 2016)\n- the hole in the ozone layer (E4) (Hufford and Horwitz, 2005)\n- the First Law of Thermodynamics (E89) (Craig and Gislason, 2002)\n- the Bermuda Triangle (E53) (Dolan, 2005)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E77(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n" ],

Instances of E81 Transformation are therefore distinct from re-classifications (documented using E17 Type Assignment) or modifications (documented using E11 Modification) of objects that do not fundamentally change their nature or identity. Characteristic cases are reconstructions and repurposing of historical buildings or ruins, fires leaving buildings in ruins, taxidermy of specimen in natural history.\nEven though such instances of E81 Transformation are often motivated by a change of intended use, substantial material changes should justify the documentation of the result as a new instance of E18 Physical Thing and not just the change of function. The latter may be documented as an extended activity (instance of E7 Activity) of using it.\n\nExamples:\n- the mummification of Tut-Ankh-Amun (E81, E12) [the mummification of the body of the deceased is a human production process and simultaneously preserves structures of the body at and before death] (Carter and Mace 1977)\n- the death, carbonization and petrification of some people of Pompeii in 79AD by the intense heat of a pyroclastic cloud and ashes from the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius (E69, E81)\n- the transformation of the Hephaisteion temple in Athens, better known as “Theseion”, into a Christian church, dedicated to Saint George <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George> around AD 700 (E81,E12) [which actually helped preserving part of the antique temple structure from 449BC]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E81(x) ⇒ E63(x)\n- E81(x) ⇒ E64(x)\n" ],

It does not, however, imply changes of any other kinds of rights. The recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E8 Acquisition there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances, it may describe:\n1. the beginning of ownership\n2. the end of ownership\n3. the transfer of ownership\n4. the acquisition from an unknown source\n5. the loss of title due to destruction of the item\nIt may also describe events where a collector appropriates legal title, for example, by annexation or field collection. The interpretation of the museum notion of “accession” differs between institutions. The CIDOC CRM therefore models legal ownership (E8 Acquisition) and physical custody (E10 Transfer of Custody) separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.\n\nExamples:\n- the collection of a hammerhead shark, genus Sphyrna (Carchariniformes), by John Steinbeck and Edward Ricketts at Puerto Escondido in the Gulf of Mexico on 25(th) March 1940.

In other words, instances of this class fix a slice of another instance of E92 Spacetime Volume in time. \nThe temporal extent of an instance of E93 Presence typically is predetermined by the researcher so as to focus the investigation particularly on finding the spatial extent of the phenomenon by testing for its characteristic features. There are at least two basic directions such investigations might take. The investigation may wish to determine where something was during some time or it may wish to reconstruct the total passage of a phenomenon’s spacetime volume through an examination of discrete presences. Observation and measurement of features indicating the presence or absence of a phenomenon in some space allows for the progressive approximation of spatial extents through argumentation typically based on inclusion, exclusion and various overlaps.\n\nExamples:\n- the Roman Empire on 19(th) August AD 14 (Clare and Edwards, 1992)\n- Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s whereabouts in December 1775 (Leppmann, 1970)\n- Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s whereabouts from 19(th) November 1755 until 9(th) April 1768 (Leppmann, 1970)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E93(x) ⇒ E92(x)\n" ],

For example, an object may be the desk, now in a museum, on which a treaty was signed. The instance of E53 Place and the instance of E52 Time-Span where and when these events happened provide constraints about the presence of the related instance E77 Persistent Item in the past.

For example, an object may be the desk, now in a museum, on which a treaty was signed. The instance of E53 Place and the instance of E52 Time-Span where and when these events happened provide constraints about the presence of the related instance E77 Persistent Item in the past. Instances of E90 Symbolic Object, in particular information objects, are physically present in events via at least one of the instances of E18 Physical Thing carrying them. Note, that the human mind can be such a carrier. A precondition for a transfer of information to a person or another new physical carrier is the presence of the respective information object and this person or physical thing in one event.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- Deckchair 42 (E19) was present at the sinking of the Titanic (E5).

This allows for describing the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence.

This real spatiotemporal extent of the instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded as being unique, in all its details and fuzziness; the identity and existence of the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume depend uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing, whose existence defines it. It constitutes a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013).\nIncluded in this spacetime volume are both the spaces filled by the matter of the physical thing and any inner space that may exist, for instance the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a finite number of individually contiguous subsets of this spacetime volume equal to the number of objects that constitute the set and that are never connected during its existence.\n\nExamples:\n- H.M.S. Temeraire (E22) defines the spacetime volume of H.M.S. Temeraire (E92). [it was built, during 1798, in Chatham and destroyed, during 1838, in Rotherhithe] (Willis, 2010)\n- The Saint Titus reliquary (E22) defines the spacetime volume of the Saint Titus reliquary (E92). [the reliquary has been produced by the workshop of the Vogiatzis brothers located at Monastiraki, Athens, in 1966 as container for the skull of Saint Titus, which was placed into it at that time and has since then continued to fall within the container’s spacetime volume. The reliquary with the skull has been kept in the Saint Titus Church in Heraklion, Crete since 1966] (Fisher & Garvey, 2010; Panotis, 2016)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P196(x,y) ⇒ E18(x)\n- P196(x,y) ⇒ E92(y)\n" ],

This real spatiotemporal extent of the instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded as being unique, in all its details and fuzziness; the identity and existence of the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume depend uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing, whose existence defines it. It constitutes a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013).\nIncluded in this spacetime volume are both the spaces filled by the matter of the physical thing and any inner space that may exist, for instance the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a finite number of individually contiguous subsets of this spacetime volume equal to the number of objects that constitute the set and that are never connected during its existence.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- H.M.S. Temeraire (E22) defines the spacetime volume of H.M.S. Temeraire (E92). [it was built, during 1798, in Chatham and destroyed, during 1838, in Rotherhithe] (Willis, 2010)\n- The Saint Titus reliquary (E22) defines the spacetime volume of the Saint Titus reliquary (E92). [the reliquary has been produced by the workshop of the Vogiatzis brothers located at Monastiraki, Athens, in 1966 as container for the skull of Saint Titus, which was placed into it at that time and has since then continued to fall within the container’s spacetime volume. The reliquary with the skull has been kept in the Saint Titus Church in Heraklion, Crete since 1966] (Fisher & Garvey, 2010; Panotis, 2016)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P196(x,y) ⇒ E18(x)\n- P196(x,y) ⇒ E92(y)\n" ],

This property includes in particular identification by mathematical expressions such as coordinate systems used for the identification of instances of E53 Place. The property does not reveal anything about when, where and by whom this identifier was used. A more detailed representation can be made using the fully developed (i.e. indirect) path through E15 Identifier Assignment.\nThis property is a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P140i was attributed by, E15 Identifier Assignment, P37 assigned to E42 Identifier. \nIt is also a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P1 is identified by, E41 Appellation, P139 has alternative form to E41 Appellation.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The capital of Italy (E53) is identified by “Rome” (E41). (Leach, 2017)\n- Text 25014–32 (E33) is identified by “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” (E35).

For example, a general condition state of “in ruins” may be decomposed into the individual stages of decay. \nThis property is transitive and asymmetric.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The Condition State of the ruined Parthenon (E3) consists of the bombarded state after the explosion of a Venetian shell in 1687 (E3).

In\n      the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written \"2011/2012\"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL.\n      Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\".<br/><br/>\n\nOpen-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date.
