Scope note:
This property associates an Entity with a particular Genre. The Genre is defined as a subclass of E55 Type and represents a category of artistic, stylistic, thematic, or aesthetic classification. Whether applied to an artist or a creative work, the property genre consistently indicates the genre within which the work or the artist’s creative output is situated. 

Examples:
- An artist might be associated with the genre \"Impressionism\" to indicate that their body of work is typically aligned with this artistic style.
- A painting (as a physical artefact) may be categorized under \"Portrait\" to denote the genre of the artwork."@en)

Scope note:
This property associates an Entity with a specific Social Movement. A Social Movement is defined as a loosely organized effort by a large group of people to achieve a particular set of goals (e.g., political, cultural, or religious change). Through this property, one can record an artist’s participation in or influence from a social movement and, similarly, document how a creative work may be representative of or inspired by such a movement. 

Examples:
- An artist (E21 Person) who was actively involved in the Civil Rights Movement might be linked via the movement property to that Social Movement.
- A poster or photograph (E22 Physical Artefact) produced during a protest could be associated with the relevant Social Movement that motivated its creation."@en)

Scope note:
This property links an instance of an Actor (typically an instance of E21 Person) with a Field of Work, an element of the controlled vocabulary defined as a subclass of E55 Type. It is used to classify the professional or creative domain in which an Actor (especially an artist) is active. 

Examples:
- An artist (E21 Person) might have a fieldOfWork assignment indicating they work in “Painting” (an instance of Field of Work).
- A creator could be linked to the fieldOfWork “Sculpture” as well as “Mixed Media,” reflecting multiple areas of engagement."@en)

A Social Movement is a loosely organized effort by a large group of people to achieve a particular set of goals, typically aiming to promote or resist changes in society's structure or values. These movements are characterized by collective action, where individuals unite based on shared beliefs or objectives, often seeking social, political, economic, or cultural transformations. ​

Social movements differ from formal organizations in that they may lack a defined organizational structure or formal membership, relying instead on informal networks and shared commitments. They can vary widely in size and scope, ranging from localized grassroots initiatives to large-scale national or international campaigns. The methods employed can include protests, demonstrations, advocacy, and other forms of collective action aimed at influencing public opinion and policy. ​

This class comprises physical artefacts that are primarily created as expressions of aesthetic, conceptual, or symbolic intent. Artworks encompass a wide range of tangible objects produced through artistic practices, including but not limited to paintings, sculptures, installations, and mixed-media pieces.​

Artworks are distinguished by their purpose of conveying artistic expression, emotion, or commentary, rather than serving utilitarian functions. They are often characterized by their unique form, style, and the creative processes involved in their production.​

While all artworks are physical artefacts, not all physical artefacts qualify as artworks; the classification depends on the creator's intent and the cultural context attributing artistic value to the object.​
