Museums operate as collective entities, often encompassing various departments and professionals, and may be public or private institutions.​\n\nAs instances of E74 Group, museums are characterized by their organizational structure and collective actions aimed at the stewardship of cultural artifacts and information. They may also engage in activities such as publishing, educational programming, and community outreach.​\n\nMuseums can vary widely in scope and specialization, including but not limited to art museums, history museums, science museums, and ethnographic museums. Their defining feature is the systematic curation and presentation of collections to the public or specific audiences.​\n\nExamples:\n- The British Museum​\n- The Louvre​\n- The Metropolitan Museum of Art​\n- The National Museum of Denmark\"@en"
